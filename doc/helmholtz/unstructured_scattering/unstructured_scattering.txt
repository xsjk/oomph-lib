\mainpage Example problem: Solving the Helmholtz equation on an unstructured mesh

In this document we revisit the solution of the Helmholtz equation
and demonstrate how to simulate the scattering of a
planar wave from a circular cylinder using an unstructured mesh.

\section scattering A specific example: Scattering of an acoustic wave from a sound-hard obstacle. 
 
We revisit the problem considered in 
<a href="../../scattering/html/index.html">another tutorial</a>:
the scattering of a planar sound wave impacting on a rigid, impermeable
obstacle as shown in this sketch:

\section results Results
The figure below shows plots of the real and imaginary parts of the
fluid's displacement potential \f$ \phi \f$ (a measure of the
fluid pressure). The red and green lines correspond to the
computed and exact analytical solutions, respectively.
(We refer to <a href="../../scattering/html/index.html">another
tutorial</a>
for details.)

\section num The numerical solution
The driver code for this problem is very similar to the one discussed in
<a href=../../scattering/html/index.html>another tutorial</a>.

shows you the differences, the most important of which are:
- the setup of the unstructured mesh, ensuring that mesh adaptation
  respects the curvilinear boundaries.
  \n\n
- the re-assignment of element properties following any
  mesh adaptation -- we refer to 
  <a href="../../../meshes/mesh_from_inline_triangle/html/index.html">
  another tutorial</a> for a more detailed discussion of why
  this is necessary.

That's all!
