\mainpage A simple fluid-structure interaction problem: Finite Reynolds number flow, driven by an oscillating ring. 


This is a very simple fluid-structure interaction problem: We study
the finite-Reynolds number internal flow generated by an oscillating
ring. The wall motion only has a single degree of freedom: The ring's
average radius, which needs to be adjusted to conserve mass. [This is
a warm-up problem for the full fluid structure interaction problem
discussed in the next example]. We compare the predictions for the
flow field against asymptotic results.

The nodal positions in the fluid domain is updated by \c
MacroElements.
