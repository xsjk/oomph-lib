\mainpage A real fluid-structure interaction problem: Finite Reynolds number flow in an oscillating elastic ring.

Our first "real" fluid-structure interaction problem: We study
the finite-Reynolds number internal flow generated by the motion 
of an oscillating elastic ring and compare the results against
asymptotic predictions.
