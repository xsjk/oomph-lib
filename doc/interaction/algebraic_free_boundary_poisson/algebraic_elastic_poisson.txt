\mainpage Demo problem: Solution of a "free-boundary" Poisson problem in an "elastic" domain revisited -- this time with AlgebraicElements


Detailed documentation to be written. Here's a plot of the result
and the already fairly well documented driver code...

@I w 0.75\textwidth elastic_fish "Adaptive solution of Poisson's equation in a fish-shaped domain for various `widths' of the domain. "

@I w 0.75\textwidth trace "Solution of Poisson's equation at a control node as a function of the `width' of the domain. "
