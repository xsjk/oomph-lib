\mainpage A simple fluid-structure interaction problem revisited: Finite Reynolds number flow, driven by an oscillating ring -- mesh update done by AlgebraicElements. 


We re-visit the simple fluid-structure interaction problem
considered in the <A HREF="../../osc_ring_macro/html/index.html">
earlier example</A>.This time we perform the update of the
nodal positions with \c AlgebraicElements.
