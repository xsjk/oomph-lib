\mainpage Demo problem: Solution of a Poisson problem in an "elastic" domain


Detailed documentation to be written. Here's a plot of the result
and the already fairly well documented driver code...

@I w 0.75\textwidth elastic_poisson "Adaptive solution of Poisson's equation in a fish-shaped domain for various `widths' of the  domain. The update of the nodal positions in response to changes in the boundary shape is done by pseudo-elasticity. "
