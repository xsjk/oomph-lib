\mainpage Time-harmonic acoustic fluid-structure interaction problems


In this document we discuss the solution of 
time-harmonic acoustic fluid-structure interaction problems.
 We start by reviewing the relevant theory and then 
present the solution of a simple model problem -- the sound radiation
from an oscillating circular cylinder that is coated with a compressible
elastic layer.

This problem combines the problems discussed in the tutorials 
illustrating
- <a href="../../../time_harmonic_linear_elasticity/elastic_annulus/html/index.html">the solution of the time-harmonic equations of linear elasticity</a>
.
and
- <a href="../../../helmholtz/scattering/html/index.html">the Helmholtz

\section theory Theory: Time-harmonic acoustic fluid-structure interaction problems

The figure below shows a sketch of a representative model problem:
a circular cylinder is immersed in an inviscid compressible fluid and
performs a prescribed two-dimensional harmonic oscillation of radian
frequency \f$\omega\f$. The cylinder is coated with a compressible elastic 
layer. We wish to compute the displacement field in the elastic coating
(assumed to be described by the <a href="../../../time_harmonic_linear_elasticity/elastic_annulus/html/index.html">equations of
time-harmonic linear elasticity</a>) and the pressure distribution
in the fluid (governed by 
<a href="../../../helmholtz/scattering/html/index.html">the Helmholtz
equation</a>). The two sets of equations interact at the interface
between fluid and solid: the fluid pressure exerts a traction
onto the elastic layer, while the motion of the elastic layer
drives the fluid motion via the non-penetration condition.

\subsection fluid The fluid model: the Helmholtz equation
We describe the behaviour of the fluid in terms of the displacement
field, \f$ d_i^*(x_j^*,t^*)\f$, of the fluid particles. As usual
we employ index notation and the summation convention, 
and use asterisks to distinguish dimensional quantities from 
their non-dimensional equivalents. The fluid is inviscid
and compressible, with a bulk modulus \f$ B \f$, such 
that the acoustic pressure is given by 
\f$ P^* = - B \ \partial d_j^*/\partial x_j^* \f$ 
We assume that the fluid motion is irrotational and can be described by a
displacement potential \f$\Phi^*\f$, such that \f$ d^*_j = \partial
\Phi^*/\partial x_j^*. \f$  We consider steady-state time-harmonic 
oscillations and write the displacement potential and the pressure 
as \f$\Phi^*(x_j^*,t^*) =
\mbox{Re} \{\phi^*(x_j^*) \exp(-{\rm i} \omega t^*)\} \f$ and
\f$P^*(x_j^*,t^*) = \mbox{Re}\{p^*(x_j^*) \exp(-{\rm i} \omega
t^*)\}\f$, respectively,
where \f$\mbox{Re}\{\ldots \}\f$ denotes the real part.
For small disturbances, the linearised Euler equation reveals that the 
time-harmonic pressure is related to the displacement potential
via \f$ p^* = \rho_{\rm f} \omega^2 \phi^*\f$ where
\f$ \rho_{\rm f} \f$ is the ambient fluid density. 
We non-dimensionalise all lengths
on a problem-specific lengthscale \f$ {\cal L}\f$ (e.g. the 
outer radius of the coating layer) such that
\f$x_j^* = {\cal L} x_j,\ d_j^* = {\cal L} d_j\f$ and \f$\phi^*
= {\cal L}^2 \phi\f$. The non-dimensional displacement potential \f$\phi\f$
is then governed by the Helmholtz equation
\f[
\frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial x_j^{2}} + k^2 \phi = 0,
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ @E[fluid_pde]@
\f]
where the square of the non-dimensional wavenumber,
\f[
k^2 = \frac{\rho_f (\omega {\cal L})^2}{B},
\f]
represents the ratio of the typical
inertial fluid pressure induced by the wall oscillation to the
`stiffness' of the fluid.

\subsection elastic The solid model: the time harmonic equations of linear elasticity
We model the coating layer as a linearly elastic solid, described
in terms of a displacement field \f$U^*_i(x_j^*,t^*)\f$, with stress tensor
\f[
\tau_{ij}^* = E \left[ \frac{\nu}{(1+\nu)(1-2\nu)} \, \frac{\partial
    U_k^*}{\partial x_k^*} \, \delta_{ij}
+\frac{1}{2(1+\nu)}\left(
\frac{\partial U_i^*}{\partial x_j^*}+
\frac{\partial U_j^*}{\partial x_i^*}
\right) \right],
\f]
where \f$E\f$ and \f$\nu\f$ are the material's Young's modulus and Poisson's
ratio, respectively.
As before, we assume a time-harmonic solution with frequency
\f$\omega\f$ so that
\f$U_i^*(x_j^*,t^*) = {\rm Re} \{ u_i^*(x_j^*) \exp(-{\rm i}\omega
t^*)\}\f$,
and we non-dimensionalise the displacements on \f${\cal L}\f$ and the
stress on Young's modulus, \f$E\f$, so that \f$u_j^* = {\cal L} u_j\f$ and
\f$\tau_{ij}^* = E \tau_{ij}\f$. The deformation of the elastic coating
is then governed by the time-harmonic Navier-Lame equations
\f[
\frac{\partial \tau_{ij}}{\partial x_j} + \Omega^2 u_i = 0,
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ @E[solid_pde]@
\f]
which depend (implicitly) on Poisson's ratio \f$\nu\f$, and on
the (square of the) non-dimensional wavenumber 
\f[
\Omega^2 = \frac{\rho_{\rm s} (\omega {\cal L})^2}{E},
\f]
where \f$ \rho_{\rm s} \f$ is the solid density.
The parameter \f$ \Omega^2 \f$ represents the ratio of the typical
inertial solid pressure induced by the wall oscillation to the
stiffness of the elastic coating. We note that for a `light'
coating we have  \f$\Omega \ll 1\f$.

 
\subsection bc Boundary conditions
The inner surface of the elastic coating, \f$ \partial D_{\rm s} \f$, 
is subject to the prescribed
displacement imposed by the oscillating cylinder. For instance, if the inner
cylinder performs axisymmetric oscillations of non-dimensional
amplitude \f$ \epsilon\f$, we have
\f[
\mbox{\bf u} = \epsilon \, \mbox{\bf e}_r 
\mbox{\ \ \ \ \ on $\partial D_{\rm s}$},
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ @E[displ_bc]@
\f]
where \f$ \mbox{\bf e}_r \f$ is the unit vector in the radial direction.
The fluid-loaded surface of the elastic coating, \f$ \partial D_{\rm
f} \f$,
is subject to the
fluid pressure. The non-dimensional traction exerted by the
fluid onto the solid (on the solid stress scale) is therefore given by
\f[
t_i^{\rm [solid]} = \tau_{ij}^{\rm [solid]} n_j = - \phi \  Q \ n_i
\mbox{\ \ \ \ \ on $\partial D_{\rm f}$},
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ @E[fsi_for_solid]@
\f]
where the \f$n_i\f$ are the components of the outer unit normal on the solid
boundary \f$\partial D_{\rm f}\f$ and
\f[
Q=\frac{\rho_{\rm f}({\cal L}\omega)^2}{E}
\f]
is the final non-dimensional parameter in the problem. It represents the
ratio of the typical inertial fluid pressure induced by the wall
oscillation to the stiffness of the elastic coating. The parameter \f$Q\f$
therefore provides a measure of the strength of the fluid-structure 
interaction (FSI) in the sense that for \f$Q \to 0\f$ 
the elastic coating does not `feel' the presence of the fluid.

The fluid is forced by the normal displacement of the solid. Imposing
the non-penetration condition \f$(d_j - u_j) n_j = 0\f$ on \f$\partial
D_{\rm f}\f$ yields a Neumann condition for the displacement
potential,
\f[
\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial n} = u_j n_j
\mbox{\ \ \ \ \ on $\partial D_{\rm f}$}.
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ @E[fsi_for_fluid]@
\f]
Finally, the displacement potential for the fluid must satisfy the
Sommerfeld radiation condition
\f[
\lim_{r \to \infty} \sqrt{r}\left( \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial r} -
    {\rm i} k \phi \right) = 0
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ @E[sommerfeld]@
\f]
which ensures that the oscillating cylinder does not generate any incoming
waves.

\section impl Implementation
The implementation of the coupled problem follows the usual procedure 
for multi-domain problems in \c oomph-lib. We discretise the
constituent single-physics problems using the existing single-physics
elements, here \c oomph-lib's
- <a href="../../../helmholtz/scattering/html/index.html">Helmholtz
elements</a>
.
and 
- <a href="../../../time_harmonic_linear_elasticity/elastic_annulus/html/index.html">
  time-harmonic linear elasticity elements</a>
.
for the discretisation of the PDEs (@R[fluid_pde]@) and 
(@R[solid_pde]@), respectively.
The displacement boundary condition (@R[displ_bc]@) on the inner surface
of the elastic coating is imposed as usual by pinning
the relevant degrees of freedom, exactly as in a <a href="../../../time_harmonic_linear_elasticity/elastic_annulus/html/index.html">single-physics
solid mechanics problem</a>. Similarly, the 
Sommerfeld radiation condition (@R[sommerfeld]@) on the outer boundary
of the fluid domain can be imposed by any of the methods
available for the solution of the single-physics
Helmholtz equation, such as 
<a href="../../../helmholtz/scattering/html/index.html#ABCs">
 approximate/absorbing boundary conditions (ABCs)</a>
or a <a href="../../../helmholtz/scattering/html/index.html#DtN">
Dirichlet-to-Neumann mapping.</a>

The boundary conditions (@R[fsi_for_solid]@) and 
(@R[fsi_for_fluid]@) at the fluid-solid interface are 
traction boundary conditions for the solid, and Neumann boundary
conditions for the Helmholtz equation, respectively. In a single-physics problem
we would impose such boundary conditions by attaching suitable \c FaceElements
to the appropriate boundaries of the "bulk" elements, as shown in the
sketch below: \c TimeHarmonicLinearElasticityTractionElements could be used to
impose a (given) traction, \f$ {\bf t}_0\f$, onto the solid;
\c HelmholtzFluxElements could be used to impose a (given) normal derivative,
\f$ f_0\f$, on the displacement potential. Both \f$ {\bf t}_0\f$
and \f$ f_0 \f$ would usually be specified in a user-defined namespace
and accessed via function pointers as indicated in the right half of
the sketch.

@I w 0.6\textwidth single_physics "Sketch illustrating the imposition of flux and traction boundary conditions in single-physics problems. The continuous problems are shown on the left; the discretised ones on the right. "


In the coupled problem, illustrated in the left half of the 
next sketch, the traction acting on the solid becomes a function 
of the displacement potential via the boundary condition 
(@R[fsi_for_solid]@), while the normal derivative of the
displacement potential is given in terms of the solid displacement via 
equation (@R[fsi_for_fluid]@). Note that corresponding points on the
FSI boundary \f$ \partial D_{\rm f}\f$ are 
identified by matching values of the boundary
coordinate \f$ \zeta \f$ which is assumed to be consistent between
the two domains. 
 
The implementation of this interaction in the discretised problem 
is illustrated in the right half of the sketch: We replace the single-physics 
\c HelmholtzFluxElements by \c HelmholtzFluxFromNormalDisplacementBCElements,
and the \c TimeHarmonicLinearElasticityTractionElements by
\c TimeHarmonicLinElastLoadedByHelmholtzPressureBCElements.
(Yes, we like to be verbose...).
Both of these \c FaceElements are derived from the \c ElementWithExternalElement
base class and can therefore store a pointer to an "external"
element that provides the information required to impose the
appropriate boundary condition. Thus, the \c
HelmholtzFluxFromNormalDisplacementBCElements store pointers to 
the "adjacent" time-harmonic linear elasticity elements (from which
they obtain the boundary displacement required for the imposition of
(@R[fsi_for_fluid]@)),
while the \c TimeHarmonicLinElastLoadedByHelmholtzPressureBCElements
store pointers to the "adjacent" Helmholtz elements that provide the
value of the displacement potential required for the evaluation of
(@R[fsi_for_solid]@).


@I w 0.6\textwidth multi_physics "Sketch illustrating the imposition of flux and traction boundary conditions in the coupled multi-physics problem.  The continuous problems are shown on the left; the discretised ones on the right. "

The identification of the "adjacent" bulk elements can be performed using the 
\c Multi_domain_functions::setup_bulk_elements_adjacent_to_face_mesh(...)
helper function. We note that, as suggested by the sketch above,
this  function does not require to the two adjacent meshes
to have a consistent discretisation -- the identification of
adjacent elements is based entirely on the (assumed to be
consistent) boundary coordinate \f$ \zeta \f$ in the two meshes.
We refer to 
<A HREF="../../../poisson/fish_poisson2/html/index.html#boundary_coords"> 
another tutorial</a> for a discussion of how to set up (or change)
the parametrisation of mesh boundaries by boundary coordinates.

\section num_soln The numerical solution

\subsection namespace The global namespace

As usual we define the problem parameters in a namespace.
\dontinclude acoustic_fsi.cc
\skipline start_namespace
\until TimeHarmonicIsotropicElasticityTensor

We wish to perform parameter studies in which we vary the FSI parameter
\f$ Q \f$. To make this physically meaningful, we interpret 
\f$ Q =(\rho_{\rm f}({\cal L}\omega)^2)/E \f$ 
as a measure of the stiffness of the elastic coating
(so that an increase in \f$ Q \f$ corresponds to a reduction in the
layer's elastic modulus \f$ E \f$). In that case, the frequency
parameter \f$ \Omega^2 = (\rho_{\rm s} (\omega {\cal L})^2)/E \f$ 
in the time-harmonic linear elasticity
equations becomes a dependent parameter and is given
in terms of the density ratio \f$ \rho_{\rm solid}/\rho_{\rm fluid}
\f$ and \f$ Q \f$ by \f$ \Omega^2 = (\rho_{\rm solid}/\rho_{\rm fluid}) Q\f$.
We therefore provide a helper function to update the dependent parameter
following any change in the independent parameters.

\until }

We force the system by imposing a prescribed displacement
on the inner surface of the elastic coating and allow this to vary
in the azimuthal direction with wavenumber \f$ N \f$:

\until } 

The rest of the namespace contains lengthy expressions for
various exact solutions and is omitted here.

\subsection main The driver code
The driver code is very straightforward. We parse the command line
to determine the parameters for the parameter study and build
the problem object, using refineable nine-noded quadrilateral elements for
the solution of the time-harmonic elasticity and Helmholtz
equations. 

\dontinclude acoustic_fsi.cc
\skipline start_of_main
\until > problem

We then solve the problem for various values of \f$ Q \f$, updating
the dependent variables after every increment.

\subsection class The problem class

The \c Problem class is templated by the types of the
"bulk" elements used to discretise the time-harmonic linear elasticity
and Helmholtz equations, respectively. It contains the 
usual member functions
to detach and attach \c FaceElements from the bulk meshes
before and after any mesh adaptation, respectively. 
\dontinclude acoustic_fsi.cc
\skipline begin_problem
\until create_helmholtz_DtN_elements()

The private member data includes storage for the various meshes
and objects that are used for outputting the results.

\subsection constr The problem constructor
We start by building the meshes for the elasticity and Helmholtz
equations. Both domains are complete annular regions, so the
annular mesh (which is built from a rectangular quad mesh) is
periodic. 

\dontinclude acoustic_fsi.cc
\skipline start_of_constructor
\until azimuthal_fraction

The solid mesh occupies the region between \f$ r = 1-h \f$ and \f$ r=1
\f$ where \f$ h \f$ is the thickness of the elastic coating:

\until H_coating);


The Helmholtz mesh occupies the region between \f$ r = 1 \f$ and \f$
r=R_{\rm outer} \f$ where \f$ R_{\rm outer}\f$ is the outer radius of 
the computational domain where we will apply the Sommerfeld radiation 
condition. Note that the two meshes are not matching -- both meshes
have 3 element layers in the radial direction but 10 and 11
in the azimuthal direction, respectively. This is done mainly 
to illustrate our claim that the multi-domain setup functions
can operate with non-matching meshes.

\until h_thick_helmholtz);

Both bulk meshes are adaptive so we create error estimators for them:

\until Helmholtz_mesh_pt->spatial_error_estimator_pt()

Next we create the mesh that will store the \c FaceElements that
will apply the Sommerfeld radiation condition, using the specified
number of Fourier terms in the Dirichlet-to-Neumann mapping;
see the <a href="../../../helmholtz/scattering/html/index.html#DtN">Helmholtz
tutorial</a> for details.

\until nfourier);

Next we pass the problem parameters to the bulk elements. The
elasticity elements require a pointer to the elasticity tensor
and the frequency parameter \f$ \Omega^2 \f$:

\until }

The Helmholtz elements need a pointer to the (square of the)
wavenumber, \f$ k^2 \f$:

\until }

It is always a good idea to check the enumeration of the mesh
boundaries to facilitate the application of boundary conditions:

\until helmholtz_mesh_boundary.dat

Next we create the meshes containing the various \c FaceElements
used to apply to the FSI traction boundary condition
(@R[fsi_for_solid]@), the FSI flux boundary condition (@R[fsi_for_fluid]@)
for the Helmholtz equation, and the Sommerfeld radiation condition 
(@R[sommerfeld]@), respectively, using helper functions discussed
below.

\until create_helmholtz_DtN_elements


We add the various sub-meshes to the problem and build the global mesh

\until build_global_mesh();

The solid displacements are prescribed on the inner boundary
(boundary 0) of the solid mesh so we pin all four values 
(representing the real and imaginary parts of the displacements
in the \f$ x_1- \f$ and \f$ x_2-\f$ directions, respectively)
and assign the boundary values using the function \c
Global_Parameters::solid_boundary_displacement(...).
(The enumeration of the unknowns is discussed in 
<a href="../../../time_harmonic_linear_elasticity/elastic_annulus/html/index.html#element_types">another tutorial</a>.)

\until }

Finally, we set up the fluid-structure interaction, assign the
equation numbers, define the output directory and open a trace
file to record the radiated power as a function of the FSI
parameter \f$ Q \f$.

\until end of constructor


<HR>
<HR>

\subsection before_adapt Actions before adapt
The mesh adaptation is driven by the error estimates for the bulk
elements. The various \c FaceElements must therefore be removed from
the global mesh before the adaptation takes place. We do this by 
calling the helper function \c delete_face_elements(...) (discussed
below) for the three face meshes, before rebuilding the Problem's global mesh.

\subsection after_adapt Actions after adapt
After the (bulk-)mesh has been adapted, the various \c FaceElements must 
be re-attached. We then (re-)setup the fluid-structure interaction
and rebuild the global mesh.

\skipline start_of_actions_after_adapt
\until }// end of actions_after_adapt

\subsection delete Delete face elements
The helper function \c delete_face_elements() is used
to delete all \c FaceElements in a given surface mesh
before the mesh adaptation.

\subsection create_flux Creating the FSI traction elements (and the FSI flux and DtN elements) 
The function \c create_fsi_traction_elements() creates the \c FaceElements
required to apply the FSI traction boundary condition
(@R[fsi_for_solid]@) on the outer boundary (boundary 2) of the solid
mesh:

\dontinclude acoustic_fsi.cc
\skipline start_of_create_fsi_traction_elements
\until add_element_pt

To function properly, the elements need to know the number of the
bulk mesh boundary they are attached to (this allows them to
determine the boundary coordinate \f$ \zeta \f$ required to
set up the fluid-structure interaction; see \ref impl ), and
the FSI parameter \f$ Q \f$.

\until } // end of create_traction_elements


[\b Note: We omit the listings of the functions
\c create_helmholtz_fsi_flux_elements() and 
\c create_helmholtz_DtN_elements()
which create the \c FaceElements
required to apply the FSI flux boundary condition
(@R[fsi_for_fluid]@) on the inner boundary (boundary 0),
and the Sommerfeld radiation condition (@R[sommerfeld]@) 
on the outer boundary (boundary 2) of the Helmholtz mesh because 
they are very similar.  Feel free to inspect the

\subsection fsi Setting up the fluid-structure interaction
The setup of the fluid-structure interaction requires 
the identification of the "bulk" Helmholtz elements that are 
adjacent to (the Gauss points of) the \c FaceElements 
that impose the FSI traction boundary condition (@R[fsi_for_solid]@),
in terms of the displacement potential \f$ \phi \f$ computed by these
"bulk" elements. This can be done using the helper function
\c Multi_domain_functions::setup_bulk_elements_adjacent_to_face_mesh(...)
which is templated by the type of the "bulk" element and its spatial
dimension, and takes as arguments:
- a pointer to the \c Problem, 
- the boundary ID of the FSI boundary in the "bulk" mesh, 
- a pointer to that mesh,
- a pointer to the mesh of \c FaceElements.

- This tutorial emerged from an actual research project 
  in which we investigated how efficiently the acoustic power radiated
  from an oscillating cylinder is reduced when the cylinder
  is coated with an elastic layer, exactly as in the model problem
  considered here. The paper then went on to investigate the
  effect of gaps in the coating and discovered some (rather nice)
  quasi-resonances -- values of the FSI parameter \f$ Q \f$ at which
  the radiated acoustic power increases significantly. Read all

\subsection ex Exercises
- Equation (@R[power]@) for the time-averaged radiated power 
  shows that \f$ \overline{\cal P}\f$ depends 
  on the derivatives of the displacement potential \f$ \phi \f$. This
  implies that the value for \f$ \overline{\cal P}\f$ computed from the
  finite-element solution for \f$ \phi \f$ is not
  as accurate as the displacement potential itself. Computing
  \f$ \overline{\cal P}\f$ to a certain tolerance (e.g. to 
  "graphical accuracy" as in the plot shown above) therefore tends to
  require meshes that are much finer than would be required
  if we were only interested in \f$ \phi \f$ itself.
  \n\n
  Investigate the accuracy of the computational predictions for \f$
  \overline{\cal P}\f$ by:
  \n\n
  - increasing the spatial resolution e.g. by using
    the command line flag \c --el_multiplier (which controls the number
    of elements in the mesh) and suppressing any automatic (un)refinement
    by setting the maximum number of adaptations to zero
    using the \c --max_adapt command line flag.
    \n\n
  - reducing the outer radius of the computational domain, using
    the command line flag \c --outer_radius, say.
    \n\n
  - varying the element type, from the bi-linear 
    \c RefineableQHelmholtzElement<2,2>
    to the bi-cubic \c RefineableQHelmholtzElement<2,4>, say.
  .
  \n\n
 Which of these approaches gives you the "most accuracy" for a given number of
