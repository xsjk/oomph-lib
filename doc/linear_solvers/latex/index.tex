As discussed in the \href{../../the_data_structure/html/index.html}{\texttt{ bottom-\/up discussion of {\ttfamily oomph-\/lib\textquotesingle{}s} data structure}}, by default {\ttfamily oomph-\/lib\textquotesingle{}s} Newton solver, {\ttfamily Problem\+::newton\+\_\+solve(...)} solves the linear systems arising during the Newton iteration with its default linear solver, \href{../../the_data_structure/html/classoomph_1_1SuperLUSolver.html}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily  Super\+LUSolver}}}, a wrapper to Demmel, Eistenstat, Gilbert, Li \& Liu\textquotesingle{}s sparse direct solver \href{http://crd.lbl.gov/~xiaoye/SuperLU}{\texttt{ Super\+LU.}}

{\ttfamily oomph-\/lib} provides a large number of alternative linear solvers that may be used instead. All linear solvers within the library are derived from the base class \href{../../the_data_structure/html/classoomph_1_1LinearSolver.html}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily  Linear\+Solver}}} which contains a single pure virtual function

\end{DoxyCodeInclude}
 whose task it is to compute the solution $ \delta {\bf x} $ (returned in the vector {\ttfamily result}) of the linear system  \[
{\cal J} \delta {\bf x} = -{\bf r}
\] where $ {\bf r} $ and $ {\cal J} $ are the global Jacobian and the residual vector, computed by the {\ttfamily Problem} pointed to by {\ttfamily problem\+\_\+pt}. The \href{../../the_data_structure/html/classoomph_1_1LinearSolver.html}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily  Linear\+Solver}}} class also defines linear-\/algebra-\/type interfaces that allow the solution of linear systems with matrices other than the {\ttfamily Problem\textquotesingle{}s} Jacobian matrix. However, these methods may not be implemented for all linear solvers.

{\ttfamily oomph-\/lib\textquotesingle{}s} linear solvers can be sub-\/divided into serial and parallel, and direct and iterative linear solvers. Here is a quick overview of the available linear solvers. If you are viewing this document online, the links take you directly to the solvers\textquotesingle{} class references which explain any solver-\/specific member functions.

\item {\ttfamily oomph-\/lib} provides its own implementations of various standard iterative linear solvers. They are derived from the base class \href{../../the_data_structure/html/classoomph_1_1IterativeLinearSolver.html}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily Iterative\+Linear\+Solver}}} and are typically templated by the matrix type used store the Jacobian matrix.

\hypertarget{index_direct}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Direct solvers}{Direct solvers}}\label{index_direct}
Changing {\ttfamily oomph-\/lib\textquotesingle{}s} linear solver is straightforward. For instance, to change the linear solver to {\ttfamily oomph-\/lib\textquotesingle{}s} {\ttfamily Dense\+LU} solver, simply create an instance of this solver and pass a pointer to it to the {\ttfamily Problem}. This most easily done in the {\ttfamily Problem} constructor\+:

 
\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \textcolor{comment}{//\ Change\ solver\ to\ DenseLU}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ linear\_solver\_pt()=\textcolor{keyword}{new}\ DenseLU;}

\end{DoxyCodeInclude}
 In any subsequent calls to {\ttfamily oomph-\/lib\textquotesingle{}s} Newton solver, {\ttfamily Dense\+LU} will now be used to solve the linear systems arising during the Newton iteration.

\hypertarget{index_iterative_linear_solvers}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Iterative linear solvers and preconditioners}{Iterative linear solvers and preconditioners}}\label{index_iterative_linear_solvers}
The specification of an iterative linear solver is just as easy\+: For instance, to specify {\ttfamily oomph-\/lib\textquotesingle{}s} conjugate gradient solver {\ttfamily CG} (storing the Jacobian matrix in compressed row format) as the linear solver, add

 
\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \textcolor{comment}{//\ Change\ solver\ to\ CG}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ IterativeLinearSolver*\ solver\_pt=\textcolor{keyword}{new}\ CG<CRDoubleMatrix>;}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ linear\_solver\_pt()=solver\_pt;}

\end{DoxyCodeInclude}
 to the problem constructor. We note that, by default, {\ttfamily oomph-\/lib\textquotesingle{}s} {\ttfamily Iterative\+Linear\+Solvers} perform the preconditioning using the trivial "{}identity preconditioner"{}. Most Krylov subspace solvers perform very poorly without some sort of preconditioning.

Specific preconditioners may be implemented by deriving from the {\ttfamily Preconditioner} base class, by implementing its two pure virtual functions

 
\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{\ \ \ \ ///\ Apply\ the\ preconditioner.\ Pure\ virtual\ generic\ interface}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{\ \ \ \ ///\ function.\ This\ method\ should\ apply\ the\ preconditioner\ operator\ to\ the}\textcolor{comment}{}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{\ \ \ \ ///\ vector\ r\ and\ return\ the\ vector\ z.}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{}\ \ \ \ \textcolor{keyword}{virtual}\ \textcolor{keywordtype}{void}\ preconditioner\_solve(\textcolor{keyword}{const}\ DoubleVector\&\ r,}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ DoubleVector\&\ z)\ =\ 0;}

\end{DoxyCodeInclude}
 and

 
\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{\ \ \ \ ///\ Setup\ the\ preconditioner.\ Pure\ virtual\ generic\ interface}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{\ \ \ \ ///\ function.}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ \textcolor{keyword}{virtual}\ \textcolor{keywordtype}{void}\ setup()\ =\ 0;}

\end{DoxyCodeInclude}
 Note that, by default, {\ttfamily oomph-\/lib\textquotesingle{}s} {\ttfamily Iterative\+Linear\+Solvers} employ left preconditioning.

{\ttfamily oomph-\/lib} provides fully-\/functional implementations of several general-\/purpose preconditioners. For instance, the zero-\/fill-\/in incomplete LU factorisation preconditioner ILU(0) may be employed by adding the lines

 
\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \textcolor{comment}{//\ Specify\ preconditioner}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ solver\_pt-\/>preconditioner\_pt()=\textcolor{keyword}{new}\ ILUZeroPreconditioner<CRDoubleMatrix>;\ }

\end{DoxyCodeInclude}
 to the {\ttfamily Problem} constructor.

Of particular interest is the availability of an "{}exact preconditioner"{} ~\newline
 \href{../../the_data_structure/html/classoomph_1_1SuperLUPreconditioner.html}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily Super\+LUPreconditioner}}} whose use guarantees the convergence of any iterative solver within a single iteration -- useful for code development.

{\ttfamily oomph-\/lib} provides wrappers to various third-\/party iterative linear solvers and preconditioners. We stress that these solvers are not necessarily implemented as {\ttfamily oomph-\/lib} {\ttfamily Iterative\+Linear\+Solvers} since their interfaces for the specification of preconditioners, etc may differ from those employed by {\ttfamily oomph-\/lib}. Furthermore, unlike {\ttfamily Super\+LUSolver} these solvers are not distributed as part of {\ttfamily oomph-\/lib} so you have to build/install them separately before installing {\ttfamily oomph-\/lib} ({\ttfamily oomph-\/lib\textquotesingle{}s} build machinery can do this for you if you wish; see \href{../../the_distribution/html/index.html\#external_dist}{\texttt{ installation instructions}} for details). Once this is done, they may be used like any other linear solver.

{\ttfamily oomph-\/lib} provides wrappers to the iterative linear solvers/preconditioners from the \href{http://trilinos.sandia.gov/}{\texttt{ Trilinos Project.}} The demo code \href{../../../demo_drivers/linear_solvers/TrilinosSolver_test.cc}{\texttt{ Trilinos\+Solver\+\_\+test.\+cc}} demonstrates how use various combinations of solvers/preconditioners. Here is a brief overview\+:

{\bfseries{Trilinos solvers}}

The wrappers to Trilinos\textquotesingle{} Krylov subspace solvers are implemented as {\ttfamily oomph-\/lib} {\ttfamily Iterative\+Linear\+Solvers}, allowing them to be used via the standard interfaces described above. For instance, to use {\ttfamily oomph-\/lib\textquotesingle{}s} wrapper to {\ttfamily Trilinos\textquotesingle{}} Aztec solver, using {\ttfamily Trilinos\textquotesingle{}} {\ttfamily ML} multilevel preconditioner, set the solvers and preconditioners as usual\+:

 
\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \textcolor{comment}{//\ Create\ a\ Trilinos\ Solver\ }}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ TrilinosAztecOOSolver*\ linear\_solver\_pt\ =\ \textcolor{keyword}{new}\ TrilinosAztecOOSolver;}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ }
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \textcolor{comment}{//\ Create\ the\ Trilinos\ ML\ preconditioner}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ TrilinosMLPreconditioner*\ preconditioner\_pt\ =\ \textcolor{keyword}{new}\ TrilinosMLPreconditioner;}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \textcolor{comment}{//\ Set\ the\ preconditioner\ pointer}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ linear\_solver\_pt-\/>preconditioner\_pt()\ =\ preconditioner\_pt;}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \textcolor{comment}{//\ Set\ linear\ solver}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ problem.linear\_solver\_pt()\ =\ linear\_solver\_pt;}

\end{DoxyCodeInclude}
 The actual Krylov subspace solver used by the {\ttfamily Trilinos} solver is specified by passing an enumerated flag (defined as static member data in the {\ttfamily Trilinos\+Aztec\+OOSolver} class) to the solver. For instance, {\ttfamily Trilinos\textquotesingle{}} CG, GMRES and Bi\+CGStab solvers are selected with

 
\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ \ \ linear\_solver\_pt-\/>solver\_type()\ =\ TrilinosAztecOOSolver::CG;}

\end{DoxyCodeInclude}


or


\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ \ \ linear\_solver\_pt-\/>solver\_type()\ =\ TrilinosAztecOOSolver::GMRES;}

\end{DoxyCodeInclude}
 or


\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ \ \ linear\_solver\_pt-\/>solver\_type()\ =\ TrilinosAztecOOSolver::BiCGStab;}

\end{DoxyCodeInclude}
 respectively.

{\bfseries{Trilinos preconditioners}}

{\ttfamily oomph-\/lib} provides wrappers to {\ttfamily Trilinos\textquotesingle{}} ML and IFPACK preconditioners that allows them to be used as {\ttfamily oomph-\/lib} {\ttfamily Preconditioners} that may be used with {\ttfamily oomph-\/lib\textquotesingle{}s} own {\ttfamily Iterative\+Linear\+Solvers}. Here is an example that shows how to build an instance of {\ttfamily oomph-\/lib\textquotesingle{}s} {\ttfamily GMRES}, preconditioned with its wrapper to {\ttfamily Trilinos\textquotesingle{}} {\ttfamily IFPACK} preconditioner\+:

 
\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}{0}

\hypertarget{index_hypre}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Hypre}{Hypre}}\label{index_hypre}
{\ttfamily oomph-\/lib} provides wrappers to the high-\/performance linear solvers/preconditioners from the \href{https://computation.llnl.gov/casc/linear_solvers/sls_hypre.html}{\texttt{ Scalable Linear Solvers Project.}} The demo code \href{../../../demo_drivers/linear_solvers/HypreSolver_test.cc}{\texttt{ Hypre\+Solver\+\_\+test.\+cc}} demonstrates how use various combinations of solvers/preconditioners. Here is a brief overview\+:

{\bfseries{Hypre solvers}}

The wrappers to Hypre\textquotesingle{}s Krylov subspace and AMG solvers are implemented as {\ttfamily oomph-\/lib} {\ttfamily Linear\+Solvers} (not {\ttfamily Iterative\+Linear\+Solvers!}) ~\newline
 so the interfaces for the specification of preconditioners etc. differ from those for {\ttfamily oomph-\/lib\textquotesingle{}s} own {\ttfamily Iterative\+Linear\+Solvers}.

The {\ttfamily Hypre\+Solver} is set like any other {\ttfamily Linear\+Solver\+:} 

 
\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \textcolor{comment}{//\ Create\ a\ new\ Hypre\ linear\ solver}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ HypreSolver*\ hypre\_linear\_solver\_pt\ =\ \textcolor{keyword}{new}\ HypreSolver;}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \textcolor{comment}{//\ Set\ the\ linear\ solver\ for\ problem}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ problem.linear\_solver\_pt()\ =\ hypre\_linear\_solver\_pt;}

\end{DoxyCodeInclude}


The actual solver used by the {\ttfamily Hypre\+Solver} is specified by passing an enumerated flag (defined as static member data in the {\ttfamily Hypre\+Solver} class) to the solver. For instance, {\ttfamily Hypre\textquotesingle{}s} AMG, CG, GMRES and Bi\+CGStab solvers are selected with

 
\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ \ hypre\_linear\_solver\_pt-\/>hypre\_method()\ =\ HypreSolver::BoomerAMG;}

\end{DoxyCodeInclude}
 or


\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ \ hypre\_linear\_solver\_pt-\/>hypre\_method()\ =\ HypreSolver::CG;}

\end{DoxyCodeInclude}
 or


\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ \ hypre\_linear\_solver\_pt-\/>hypre\_method()\ =\ HypreSolver::GMRES;}

\end{DoxyCodeInclude}
 or


\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ \ hypre\_linear\_solver\_pt-\/>hypre\_method()\ =\ HypreSolver::BiCGStab;}

\end{DoxyCodeInclude}
 respectively.

These Krylov subspace methods may then be preconditioned by {\ttfamily Hypre\textquotesingle{}s} own (internal) preconditioners, again by specifying the method via an enumerated flag. So, to use no preconditioning, or to precondition with {\ttfamily Boomer\+AMG} (and AMG-\/based preconditioner), {\ttfamily Euclid} (an ILU preconditioner) or {\ttfamily Para\+Sails} (a sparse approximate inverse preconditioner), set\+:


\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ hypre\_linear\_solver\_pt-\/>internal\_preconditioner()=HypreSolver::None;}

\end{DoxyCodeInclude}
 or


\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ hypre\_linear\_solver\_pt-\/>internal\_preconditioner()=HypreSolver::BoomerAMG;}

\end{DoxyCodeInclude}
 or


\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ hypre\_linear\_solver\_pt-\/>internal\_preconditioner()=HypreSolver::Euclid;}

\end{DoxyCodeInclude}
or


\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ hypre\_linear\_solver\_pt-\/>internal\_preconditioner()=HypreSolver::ParaSails;}

\end{DoxyCodeInclude}
 respectively.

{\bfseries{Hypre preconditioners}}

{\ttfamily oomph-\/lib} provides wrappers to {\ttfamily Hypre\textquotesingle{}s} preconditioners that allows them to be used as {\ttfamily oomph-\/lib} {\ttfamily Preconditioners} that may be used with {\ttfamily oomph-\/lib\textquotesingle{}s} own {\ttfamily Iterative\+Linear\+Solvers}. Here is an example that shows how to build an instance of {\ttfamily oomph-\/lib\textquotesingle{}s} {\ttfamily Bi\+CGStab} and to use the {\ttfamily Hypre\+Preconditioner} as the preconditioner\+:

 
\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \textcolor{comment}{//\ Build\ and\ instance\ of\ BiCGStab\ and\ pass\ it\ to\ the\ problem}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ oomph\_linear\_solver\_pt\ =\ \textcolor{keyword}{new}\ BiCGStab<CRDoubleMatrix>;}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ problem.linear\_solver\_pt()\ =\ oomph\_linear\_solver\_pt;}

\end{DoxyCodeInclude}
 Now we build an instance of a {\ttfamily Hypre\+Preconditioner} 

 
\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \textcolor{comment}{//\ Create\ a\ new\ Hypre\ preconditioner}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ HyprePreconditioner*\ hypre\_preconditioner\_pt\ =\ \textcolor{keyword}{new}\ HyprePreconditioner;}

\end{DoxyCodeInclude}
 and set it as the {\ttfamily Preconditioner} for {\ttfamily oomph-\/lib\textquotesingle{}s} {\ttfamily Bi\+CGStab} solver\+:


\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ oomph\_linear\_solver\_pt-\/>preconditioner\_pt()=hypre\_preconditioner\_pt;}

\end{DoxyCodeInclude}
 The actual preconditioning methodology to be used by the {\ttfamily Hypre\+Preconditioner} is again selected via enumerated flags, i.\+e.


\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ \ hypre\_preconditioner\_pt-\/>hypre\_method()\ =\ HyprePreconditioner::BoomerAMG;}

\end{DoxyCodeInclude}

In addition to "{}general-\/purpose"{} preconditioners like ILU, {\ttfamily oomph-\/lib} provides a number of problem-\/specific preconditioners which are typically based on the library\textquotesingle{}s block preconditioning framework. Separate documentation is available for these\+:
