\mainpage Demo problem: A one-dimensional eigenproblem with complex eigenvalues
In this document, we demonstrate how to solve a 1D eigenproblem
(eigenvalues of the shifted 1D Laplace operator in a bounded domain) by
creating custom elements. The tutorial is related to the 
<a href="../../harmonic/html/index.html"> harmonic eigenproblem </a>,
which you should read first. The fundamental difference in this case,
is that we treat the eigenproblem as two coupled first-order equations
which ensures that many of the eigenvalues are complex.

\frac{\partial u}{\partial

 \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ @E[1DEigen]@

in the domain \f$D =\left\{ x_1 \in 
[0,1] \right\}\f$,

 We shall treat \f$ \lambda\f$ as an eigenvalue (unknown), but the
 other parameter \f$ \mu \f$ is a \b shift, which is used to modify
 the spectrum of the operator. 
 The two first-order equations may be combined into a single
 second-order equation
\f[ \frac{\partial^{2} u}{\partial x^{2}} = (\lambda - \mu)
 \frac{\partial w}{\partial x} = (\lambda - \mu) \lambda u \quad
 \Rightarrow\quad  \frac{\partial^{2} u}{\partial x^{2}} +
 (\mu - \lambda) \lambda u = 0, \f]
which is exactly the same equation as 
the <a href="../../harmonic/html/index.html"> harmonic eigenproblem </a>,
 but with a redefinition of the eigenvalues. Hence, the exact
 solutions are given by the countably infinite set:
\f[
   u_{n} = \sin (\Lambda_{n} x_{1}), \ \ \ \ \ \ \
   \Lambda_{n} = n \pi = \sqrt{\lambda_{n}(\mu - \lambda_{n})},
\f]
  which yields
\f[ \lambda_{n} = \frac{\mu}{2} \pm \sqrt{\mu^{2}/4 -
 n^{2}\pi^{2}}. 
 \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ @E[1DEig]@ \f]
If the shift \f$\mu = 0\f$, then the eigenvalues are all imaginary and
 consist of the complex conjugate pairs given by \f$
 \lambda{n} = \pm n \pi\, \mbox{i} \f$. 

 If \f$ \mu^{2}/4 >
 \pi^{2}\f$ \f$ \Rightarrow \f$ \f$ \mu > 2\pi \f$, then the first complex
 conjugate pair of imaginary eigenvalues becomes two distinct real
 eigenvalues because the term under the square root in (@R[1DEig]@) becomes
 positive. As \f$ \mu \f$ increases further subsequent complex
 eigenvalues merge to be real. Thus, we can control the spectrum by
 modifying the parameter \f$ \mu \f$.

We now provide a detailed discussion of the driver code 
<A HREF="../../../../demo_drivers/eigenproblems/harmonic/complex_harmonic.cc">
complex_harmonic.cc</A> which solves the problem for the first four
eigenvalues, when \f$ \mu = 6.5 > 2\pi. \f$

\section theory Overview of the theory
 
\subsection weak Weak formulation of the problem

 If we wish to solve the problem (@R[1DEigen]@) using finite elements,
we simply multiply each equation by a test function, but do not
integrate by parts. We shall use the same test functions for each
variable and thus our governing equations become
\f[ \int_{D} \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} \phi^{(test)} \,\mbox{d} x = 
 (\lambda -\mu) \int_{D} w\, \phi^{(test)}\,\mbox{d} x, \quad\quad
 \int_{D} \frac{\partial w}{\partial x} \phi^{(test)} \,\mbox{d} x = 
 \lambda  \int_{D} u\, \phi^{(test)}\,\mbox{d} x, \quad
 \f]

If we expand \f$ u(x) = U_{j} \psi_{j}(x) \f$ and \f$ w(x) = W_{j}
\psi_{j}(x) \f$ in terms of
known basis functions \f$ \psi_{j} \f$ and use
the same basis functions as our test functions (Galerkin method), then the
weak form becomes
\f[ \int_{D} \frac{\partial \psi_{j}}{\partial x} \psi_{i}
\,\mbox{d} x U_{j} = (\lambda - \mu)  \int_{D}
\psi_{i} \psi_{j}\,\mbox{d} x W_{j},\quad\quad
 \int_{D} \frac{\partial \psi_{j}}{\partial x} \psi_{i}
\,\mbox{d} x W_{j} = \lambda \int_{D}
\psi_{i} \psi_{j}\,\mbox{d} x U_{j}.
 \f]
Thus, in order to form the discrete eigenproblem
\f$  J_{ij} v_{j} = \lambda M_{ij} v_{j} \f$, we choose to order the
unknowns in the form
\f$ v = [ U | W ]^{T} \f$, leading to the block Jacobian and mass matrices
\f[ J = \left[\begin{array}{c|c}
         0 &  A  \\\hline
         A & \mu B \end{array}\right],\quad
 M = \left[\begin{array}{c|c}
         B &  0  \\\hline
         0 & B \end{array}\right], \f]
 where
 \f[ A_{ij} =  \int_{D} \frac{\partial \psi_{j}}{\partial x} \psi_{i}
\,\mbox{d} x , \quad\quad  B_{ij} =  \int_{D}
\psi_{i} \psi_{j}\,\mbox{d} x. \f]

\section impl Implementation

 The implementation closely follows that in the
<a href="../../harmonic/html/index.html"> harmonic eigenproblem </a>,
and so we shall concentrate on the differences from that problem.

\subsection equations Creating the elements
 
 For generality, we implement the mathematics to assemble contributions to the
Jacobian and mass matrices defined above in the
class \c ComplexHarmonicEquations that inherits from \c
FiniteElement. 

\dontinclude complex_harmonic.cc
\skipline A class
\until ComplexHarmonicEquations()

The  unknowns that represent the discretised eigenfunction are assumed
to be stored at the nodes, but there are now two unknowns: \f$u\f$ is
assumed to be the first and \f$w\f$ is the second.

\skipline Access function
\until nodal_value(n,1)

As before, the key function is \c
fill_in_contribution_to_jacobian_and_mass_matrix 
 which implements the calculation of the equations. 

\skipline fill_in_contribution
\until end_of_fill_in

 Note that the \b shift \f$\mu\f$ is implemented in a global namespace 
 as \c EigenproblemShift::Mu.

 The shape functions are specified in the \c QComplexHarmonicElement
class that inherits from our standard one-dimensional Lagrange elements
 \c QElement<1,NNODE_1D> as well as \c HarmonicEquations.
 The number of unknowns (two) is specified and the output functions
and shape functions are overloaded as required: the output functions are
 specified in the \c ComplexHarmonicEquations class, whereas the shape
 functions are provided by the \c QElement<1,NNODE_1D> class.

\skipline template <unsigned
\until end_of_QComplexHarmonic


\section main The driver code

The driver code is identical to that of the 
<a href="../../harmonic/html/index.html"> harmonic eigenproblem </a>.

\section problem The problem class
The \c ComplexHarmonicProblem is derived from \c oomph-lib's generic
\c Problem class and the specific element
type and eigensolver are specified as template parameters to make it easy for 
the "user" to change either of these from the driver code. Once again,
it is very similar to the \c HarmonicProblem class in the
<a href="../../harmonic/html/index.html"> harmonic eigenproblem
</a>. The only member function with  any differences is the
 \c solve(...) function, which requests 7 rather than 4 eigenvalues to
 be computed and outputs the eigenfunction associated with eigenvalue
 of smallest magnitude (which is real).

\section exercises Comments and exercises

-# Modify the code to compute a different number of eigenvalues. 
   What is the maximum number of eigenvalues that could be computed? 
-# Confirm that the eigenvalues agree with the analytic result and
   that a transition from real to complex values occurs when \f$ \mu
   = 2\pi \f$.
-# Explain why there are always two eigenvalues with the values
   \f$\lambda = \mu\f$. What are the corresponding eigenfunctions?
-# When the output is a complex conjugate pair of eigenvalues, the two
   associated eigenvectors are the real and imaginary parts of the
   eigenvector corresponding to the first eigenvalue. 
   The complex conjugate eigenvalue has a complex
   conjugate eigenvector (can you prove this?), so no more information
   is required. Modify the output
   function to examine the real and imaginary parts of a complex
   eigenvalue. Are the results what you expect?
