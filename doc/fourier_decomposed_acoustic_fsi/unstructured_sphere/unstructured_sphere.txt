\mainpage The spatially-adaptive solution of azimuthally Fourier-decomposed time-harmonic 3D acoustic fluid-structure interaction problems on unstructured meshes


In this document we discuss the spatially-adaptive solution of 3D
time-harmonic acoustic fluid-structure interaction problems
in cylindrical polar coordinates on unstructured meshes.

  The driver code is very similar to the one presented in
<a href=../../sphere/html/index.html>another tutorial</a>
and we only discuss the changes necessary to deal with the generation
of the adaptive, unstructured meshes and the 
assignment of different material properties to different parts of the 
solid domain.

\section test A test problem

The sketch below shows the problem setup: An elastic sphere
which is reinforced with an azimuthal T-rib is immersed in a compressible
fluid and subjected to a time-periodic pressure load of magnitude
\f[
{\bf t} = P ( \exp(\alpha(\theta-\pi/4)^2)  + \exp(\alpha(\theta-3\pi/4)^2) )
\f]
(where \f$ \theta \f$ is the zenith angle) along 
its inner surface. The parameter \f$ \alpha \f$ controls the 
"sharpness" of the pressure load. For  \f$ \alpha=0 \f$ we obtain a 
uniform, spherically symmetric load; the sketch below shows the pressure 
distribution (red vectors indicating the traction) for \f$ \alpha = 200. \f$

\section results Results

The figure below shows an animation of the structure's time-harmonic
oscillation. The blue shaded region shows the shape of the
oscillating structure while the pink region shows its undeformed configuration.
The left half of the plot is used to show the (mirror image of
the) adaptive unstructured mesh on which the displacement field was computed:

@I w 0.8\textwidth anim "Animation of the time-harmonic deformation. "

Here is a plot of the corresponding fluid displacement potential, a 
measure of the fluid pressure:   
 
@I w 0.8\textwidth potential_unstr "The fluid displacement potential, a measure of the fluid pressure. Elevation: real part; contours: imaginary part. "

This looks very pretty and shows that we can solve acoustic FSI
problems in non-trivial geometries but should you believe the results? 
Here's an attempt to convince you: If we make the rib much softer than the
sphere and set its inertia to zero, the rib will not offer much 
structural resistance and the sphere will deform as if the rib was not present.
If we then set \f$ \alpha = 0 \f$ we apply a spherically symmetric forcing
onto the structure and would expect the resulting displacement
field (at least in the sphere) to be spherically symmetric, too.

The animation of the displacement field for this case, shown below,
shows that this is indeed the case:

Here is a plot of the corresponding fluid displacement potential, a 
measure of the fluid pressure:

\section num The numerical solution
The driver code for this problem is very similar to the one discussed in
<a href=../../sphere/html/index.html>another tutorial</a>.

shows you the differences, the most important of which are:
- The provision of multiple non-dimensional Young's moduli and frequency
  parameters for the two different regions (the rib and the 
  sphere). 
  <a href="../../../time_harmonic_fourier_decomposed_linear_elasticity/cylinder/html/index.html#comments">Recall</a>
  that the non-dimensional Young's modulus specified via \c
  TimeHarmonicFourierDecomposedLinearElasticityEquations::youngs_modulus_pt()
  represents the ratio of the material's actual Young's modulus to the
  Young's modulus used in <a href="../../../time_harmonic_fourier_decomposed_linear_elasticity/cylinder/html/index.html#theory">the
  non-dimensionalisation of the equations. </a>
  \n\n
- The change of forcing from a prescribed time-harmonic displacement
  to a pressure
  load on the inside boundary -- this requires yet another mesh of
  \c FaceElements.
  \n\n
- The provision of the \c actions_before/after_adapt() functions and a 
  helper function \c complete_problem_setup()
  which rebuilds the elements (by passing the problem parameters
  to the elements) following the unstructured mesh adaptation.
  (The need/rationale for such a function is discussed in 
  <a href="../../../meshes/mesh_from_inline_triangle/html/index.html">
  another tutorial.</a>)
  \n\n
- The mesh generation -- the specification of the curvilinear
  boundaries and the geometry of the rib is somewhat tedious.
  We refer to 
  <a href="../../../meshes/mesh_from_inline_triangle_internal_boundaries/html/index.html">
  another tutorial</a> for a discussion of how to define the
  internal mesh boundary that separates the two regions
  (the rib and the sphere) so that we can assign 
  different material properties to them. 
  \n\n
.  
All of this is reasonably straightforward and provides a
powerful code that automatically adapts both meshes while
respecting the curvilinear boundaries of the domain. 
Have a look through the driver code and play with it.
