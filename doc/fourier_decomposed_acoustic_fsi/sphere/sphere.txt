In this document we discuss the solution of 
time-harmonic acoustic fluid-structure interaction problems 
in cylindrical polar coordinates, using a Fourier decomposition of the
solution in the azimuthal direction. These equations are useful to 
solve problems involving axisymmetric elastic bodies.

 We start by reviewing the relevant theory and then 
present the solution of a simple model problem -- the sound radiation
from an oscillating sphere that is coated with a compressible
elastic layer.
 
This problem combines the problems discussed in the tutorials 
illustrating
- <a href="../../../time_harmonic_fourier_decomposed_linear_elasticity/cylinder/html/index.html">
the solution of the time-harmonic equations of 
linear elasticity in cylindrical polar coordinates</a>
.
and
- <a href="../../../fourier_decomposed_helmholtz/sphere_scattering/html/index.html">the Helmholtz
equation in cylindrical polar coordinates</a>
.

[Note that this tutorial is (obviously) very similar to its
<a href="../../../acoustic_fsi/acoustic_fsi_annulus/html/index.html">
cartesian counterpart</a>. The considerable overlap of material is deliberate
to make both tutorials reasonably self-contained and explicit.]

\section theory Theory: Time-harmonic acoustic fluid-structure interaction problems in cylindrical polar coordinates

The figure below shows a sketch of a representative model problem:
a sphere is immersed in an inviscid compressible fluid and
performs a prescribed harmonic oscillation of radian
frequency \f$\omega\f$. The sphere is coated with a compressible elastic 
layer. We wish to compute the displacement field in the elastic coating
(assumed to be described by the <a href="../../../time_harmonic_fourier_decomposed_linear_elasticity/cylinder/html/index.html">equations of
time-harmonic linear elasticity</a>) and the pressure distribution
in the fluid (governed by 
<a href="../../../fourier_decomposed_helmholtz/sphere_scattering/html/index.html">the Helmholtz
equation</a>). The two sets of equations interact at the interface
between fluid and solid: the fluid pressure exerts a traction
onto the elastic layer, while the motion of the elastic layer
drives the fluid motion via the non-penetration condition.

@I w 0.6\textwidth coated_sphere "Sketch of the model problem: Forced oscillations of a sphere (black) deform an elastic coating layer (pink) which is surrounded by a compressible fluid. "

\subsection fluid The fluid model: the Helmholtz equation
We describe the behaviour of the fluid in terms of the displacement
field, \f$ {\bf d}^*(r^*,z^*,\varphi,t^*)\f$, of the fluid particles,
where \f$r^*, z^* \f$ and \f$ \varphi \f$ are cylindrical polar coordinates. 
As usual, we use asterisks to distinguish dimensional quantities from 
their non-dimensional equivalents. The fluid is inviscid
and compressible, with a bulk modulus \f$ B \f$, such 
that the acoustic pressure is given by 
\f$ P^* = - B \ \nabla^{*} \cdot {\bf d}^* \f$ 
We assume that the fluid motion is irrotational and can be described by a
displacement potential \f$\Phi^*\f$, such that \f$ {\bf d}^*= \nabla^*
\Phi^*. \f$  We consider steady-state time-harmonic 
oscillations and write the displacement potential and the pressure 
as \f$\Phi^*(r^*,z^*,\varphi,t^*) =
\mbox{Re} \{\phi^*(r^*,z^*,\varphi) \exp(-{\rm i} \omega t^*)\} \f$ and
\f$P^*(r^*,z^*,\varphi,t^*) = \mbox{Re}\{p^*(r^*,z^*,\varphi) 
\exp(-{\rm i} \omega t^*)\}\f$, respectively,
where \f$\mbox{Re}\{\ldots \}\f$ denotes the real part.
For small disturbances, the linearised Euler equation reveals that the 
time-harmonic pressure is related to the displacement potential
via \f$ p^* = \rho_{\rm f} \omega^2 \phi^*\f$ where
\f$ \rho_{\rm f}\f$ is the ambient fluid density. 
We non-dimensionalise all lengths
on a problem-specific lengthscale \f$ {\cal L}\f$ (e.g. the 
outer radius of the coating layer) such that
\f$ [r^*, z^*] = {\cal L} [r,z], \ {\bf d}^* = {\cal L} {\bf d} \f$ 
and \f$\phi^* = {\cal L}^2 \phi\f$. 

We then decompose \f$ \phi \f$ into its Fourier components by writing
\f[
{\phi}(r,\varphi,z) = \sum_{N=-\infty}^{\infty} \phi_N(r,z) \exp({\rm i}
N \varphi).
\f]
Since the governing equations are linear we can compute each Fourier
component \f$ \phi_N(r,z) \f$ individually by solving
\f[
\nabla^2 {\phi_{N}}(r,z) + \left(k^2-\frac{N^2}{r^2}\right) \phi_N(r,z) = 0,
 \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ @E[fluid_pde]@
\f]
where the square of the non-dimensional wavenumber,
\f[
k^2 = \frac{\rho_{\rm f} (\omega {\cal L})^2}{B},
\f]
represents the ratio of the typical
inertial fluid pressure induced by the wall oscillation to the
`stiffness' of the fluid. 

\subsection elastic The solid model: the time harmonic equations of linear elasticity

We model the coating layer as a linearly elastic solid, described
in terms of a displacement field 
\f$ {\bf U}^*(r^*,z^*,\varphi,t^*)\f$, with stress tensor
\f[
\mbox{\boldmath$ \tau^*$}=\frac{E}{1+\nu}\left(
\frac{\nu}{1-2\nu}(\mbox{\boldmath$\nabla^*\cdot U^*$})\textbf{I}+
\frac{1}{2}(\mbox{\boldmath$ \nabla^* U^*$}+
\mbox{\boldmath$ \nabla^* U^*$}^{{\rm T}})\right),
\f]
where \f$E\f$ and \f$\nu\f$ are the material's Young's modulus and Poisson's
ratio, respectively. 

 As before, we assume a time-harmonic solution 
with frequency \f$ \omega\f$ so that
\f$ {\bf U}^*(r^*,z^*,\varphi,t^*) = {\rm Re} \{ 
{\bf u}^*(r^*,z^*,\varphi) \exp(-{\rm i}\omega t^*)\}\f$.
We non-dimensionalise the displacements on \f${\cal L}\f$ and the
stress on Young's modulus, \f$E\f$, so that \f${\bf u}^* = {\cal L}
{\bf u} \f$ and \f$ \mbox{\boldmath$ \tau^*$} = E \mbox{\boldmath$
\tau$}\f$.  The deformation of the elastic coating is then
governed by the time-harmonic Navier-Lame equations
<CENTER>
\f[
\mbox{\boldmath$ \nabla\cdot\tau$}+\Omega^2\mbox{\boldmath$ u$} = {\bf
0}
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ @E[solid_pde]@
\f]
</CENTER>
where 
<CENTER>
\f[
\mbox{\boldmath$ \tau $}=\frac{1}{1+\nu}\left(
\frac{\nu}{1-2\nu}(\mbox{\boldmath$\nabla\cdot u$})\textbf{I}+
\frac{1}{2}(\mbox{\boldmath$ \nabla u$}+\mbox{\boldmath$ \nabla
u$}^{{\rm T}})\right)
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ @E[nondimconstitutive]@
\f]
</CENTER>
is the non-dimensional stress tensor.
The (square of the) non-dimensional wavenumber 
\f[
\Omega^2 = \frac{\rho_{\rm s} (\omega {\cal L})^2}{E},
\f]
where \f$ \rho_{\rm s}\f$ is the solid density,
represents the ratio of the typical inertial solid pressure 
induced by the wall oscillation to the
stiffness of the elastic coating. We note that for a `light'
coating we have  \f$\Omega \ll 1\f$.

We then decompose \f$ {\bf u} \f$ into its Fourier components by writing
\f[
{\bf u}(r,\varphi,z) = \sum_{N=-\infty}^{\infty} {\bf u}_N(r,z) \exp({\rm i}
N \varphi).
\f]
This decomposition allows us to
remove the \f$ \theta \f$-dependence from the equations by writing 
\f$ \partial (.)/\partial\theta={\rm i} N (.) \f$.
Since the governing equations are linear, we can solve for each
Fourier component separately and specify the Fourier wavenumber
\f$ N \f$ as a parameter.
 
\subsection bc Boundary conditions
The inner surface of the elastic coating, \f$ \partial D_{\rm s} \f$, 
is subject to the prescribed
displacement imposed by the oscillating cylinder. For instance, if the inner
cylinder performs spherically symmetric oscillations of non-dimensional
amplitude \f$ \epsilon\f$, we have
\f[
\mbox{\bf u}_0 = \epsilon \, \mbox{\bf e}_{r_{\rm sphere}} 
\mbox{\ \ \ \ \ on $\partial D_{\rm s}$},
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ @E[displ_bc]@
\f]
where 
\f[ 
\mbox{\bf e}_{r_{\rm sphere}}  = \frac{r}{\sqrt{r^2+z^2}} {\bf e}_r +
\frac{z}{\sqrt{r^2+z^2}} {\bf e}_z
\f]
is the unit vector in the (spherically!) radial
direction, while the other Fourier components remain zero,
\f$ \mbox{\bf u}_j = {\bf 0} \f$ for \f$ j=\pm 1, \pm 2, ...\f$
The fluid-loaded surface of the elastic coating, \f$ \partial D_{\rm
f} \f$,
is subject to the
fluid pressure. The non-dimensional traction exerted by the
fluid onto the solid (on the solid stress scale) is therefore given by
\f[
{\bf t}^{\rm [solid]} = \mbox{\boldmath$ \tau $}^{\rm [solid]} \cdot {\bf n} =
 - \phi \  Q \ {\bf n}
\mbox{\ \ \ \ \ on $\partial D_{\rm f}$},
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ @E[fsi_for_solid]@
\f]
where the \f$ {\bf n} = n_r {\bf e}_r + n_z {\bf e}_z \f$ 
is the outer unit normal on the solid
boundary \f$\partial D_{\rm f}\f$ and
\f[
Q=\frac{\rho_{\rm f}({\cal L}\omega)^2}{E}
\f]
is the final non-dimensional parameter in the problem. It represents the
ratio of the typical inertial fluid pressure induced by the wall
oscillation to the stiffness of the elastic coating. The parameter \f$Q\f$
therefore provides a measure of the strength of the fluid-structure 
interaction (FSI) in the sense that for \f$Q \to 0\f$ 
the elastic coating does not `feel' the presence of the fluid.

The fluid is forced by the normal displacement of the solid. Imposing
the non-penetration condition \f$({\bf d} - {\bf u}) \cdot {\bf n} =
0\f$ on \f$\partial
D_{\rm f}\f$ yields a Neumann condition for the displacement
potential,
\f[
\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial n} = {\bf u} \cdot  {\bf n}
\mbox{\ \ \ \ \ on $\partial D_{\rm f}$}.
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ @E[fsi_for_fluid]@
\f]
Finally, the displacement potential for the fluid must satisfy the
Sommerfeld radiation condition
\f[
\lim_{r_{\rm sphere} \to \infty} r_{\rm sphere}
\left( \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial r_{\rm sphere} } -    
{\rm i} k \phi \right) = 0,
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ @E[sommerfeld]@
\f]
where \f$ r_{\rm sphere} = \sqrt{(r^2+z^2)} \f$ is the (spherical) radius.
The Sommerfeld radiation condition ensures that the 
oscillating sphere does not generate any incoming waves. 

Equations (@R[fsi_for_solid]@), (@R[fsi_for_fluid]@) and 
(@R[sommerfeld]@) apply for each Fourier component
of the solution.

\section impl Implementation
The implementation of the coupled problem follows the usual procedure 
for multi-domain problems in \c oomph-lib. We discretise the
constituent single-physics problems using the existing single-physics
elements, here \c oomph-lib's
- <a href="../../../fourier_decomposed_helmholtz/sphere_scattering/html/index.html">Helmholtz
elements</a>
.
and 
- <a href="../../../time_harmonic_fourier_decomposed_linear_elasticity/cylinder/html/index.html">
  time-harmonic linear elasticity elements</a>
.
for the discretisation of the PDEs (@R[fluid_pde]@) and 
(@R[solid_pde]@), respectively.
The displacement boundary condition (@R[displ_bc]@) on the inner surface
of the elastic coating is imposed as usual by pinning
the relevant degrees of freedom, exactly as in a <a href="../../../time_harmonic_fourier_decomposed_linear_elasticity/cylinder/html/index.html">single-physics
solid mechanics problem</a>. Similarly, the 
Sommerfeld radiation condition (@R[sommerfeld]@) on the outer boundary
of the fluid domain can be imposed by any of the methods
available for the solution of the single-physics
Helmholtz equation, such as a <a href="../../../fourier_decomposed_helmholtz/sphere_scattering/html/index.html#DtN">
Dirichlet-to-Neumann mapping.</a>

The boundary conditions (@R[fsi_for_solid]@) and 
(@R[fsi_for_fluid]@) at the fluid-solid interface are 
traction boundary conditions for the solid, and Neumann boundary
conditions for the Helmholtz equation, respectively. In a single-physics problem
we would impose such boundary conditions by attaching suitable \c FaceElements
to the appropriate boundaries of the "bulk" elements, as shown in the
sketch below: \c
TimeHarmonicFourierDecomposedLinearElasticityTractionElement 
could be used to
impose a (given) traction, \f$ {\bf t}_0\f$, onto the solid;
\c FourierDecomposedHelmholtzFluxElements could be used to 
impose a (given) normal derivative,
\f$ f_0\f$, on the displacement potential. Both \f$ {\bf t}_0\f$
and \f$ f_0 \f$ would usually be specified in a user-defined namespace
and accessed via function pointers as indicated in the right half of
the sketch.

@I w 0.6\textwidth single_physics "Sketch illustrating the imposition of flux and traction boundary conditions in single-physics problems. The continuous problems are shown on the left; the discretised ones on the right. "


In the coupled problem, illustrated in the left half of the 
next sketch, the traction acting on the solid becomes a function 
of the displacement potential via the boundary condition 
(@R[fsi_for_solid]@), while the normal derivative of the
displacement potential is given in terms of the solid displacement via 
equation (@R[fsi_for_fluid]@). Note that corresponding points on the
FSI boundary \f$ \partial D_{\rm f}\f$ are 
identified by matching values of the boundary
coordinate \f$ \zeta \f$ which is assumed to be consistent between
the two domains. 
  
The implementation of this interaction in the discretised problem 
is illustrated in the right half of the sketch: We replace the single-physics 
\c FourierDecomposedHelmholtzFluxElements by 
\c FourierDecomposedHelmholtzFluxFromNormalDisplacementBCElements,
and the \c TimeHarmonicFourierDecomposedLinearElasticityTractionElements by
\c FourierDecomposedTimeHarmonicLinElastLoadedByHelmholtzPressureBCElements.
(Yes, we like to be verbose...).
Both of these \c FaceElements are derived from the \c ElementWithExternalElement
base class and can therefore store a pointer to an "external"
element that provides the information required to impose the
appropriate boundary condition. Thus, the \c
 FourierDecomposedHelmholtzFluxFromNormalDisplacementBCElements 
store pointers to 
the "adjacent" time-harmonic linear elasticity elements (from which
they obtain the boundary displacement required for the imposition of
(@R[fsi_for_fluid]@)),
while the \c
FourierDecomposedTimeHarmonicLinElastLoadedByHelmholtzPressureBCElements
store pointers to the "adjacent" Helmholtz elements that provide the
value of the displacement potential required for the evaluation of
(@R[fsi_for_solid]@).


@I w 0.6\textwidth multi_physics "Sketch illustrating the imposition of flux and traction boundary conditions in the coupled multi-physics problem.  The continuous problems are shown on the left; the discretised ones on the right. "

The identification of the "adjacent" bulk elements can be performed using the 
\c Multi_domain_functions::setup_bulk_elements_adjacent_to_face_mesh(...)
helper function. We note that, as suggested by the sketch above,
this  function does not require to the two adjacent meshes
to have a consistent discretisation -- the identification of
adjacent elements is based entirely on the (assumed to be
consistent) boundary coordinate \f$ \zeta \f$ in the two meshes.
We refer to 
<A HREF="../../../poisson/fish_poisson2/html/index.html#boundary_coords"> 
another tutorial</a> for a discussion of how to set up (or change)
the parametrisation of mesh boundaries by boundary coordinates.

\section num_soln The numerical solution

\subsection namespace The global namespace

As usual we define the problem parameters in a namespace.
(<a href="../../../time_harmonic_fourier_decomposed_linear_elasticity/cylinder/html/index.html#comments">Recall</a>
that we allow the constitutive parameters to be complex-valued.)
\dontinclude fourier_decomposed_acoustic_fsi.cc

We wish to perform parameter studies in which we vary the FSI parameter
\f$ Q \f$. To make this physically meaningful, we interpret 
\f$ Q =(\rho_{\rm f}({\cal L}\omega)^2)/E \f$ 
as a measure of the stiffness of the elastic coating
(so that an increase in \f$ Q \f$ corresponds to a reduction in the
layer's elastic modulus \f$ E \f$). In that case, the frequency
parameter \f$ \Omega^2 = (\rho_{\rm s} (\omega {\cal L})^2)/E \f$ 
in the time-harmonic linear elasticity
equations becomes a dependent parameter and is given
in terms of the density ratio \f$ \rho_{\rm solid}/\rho_{\rm fluid}
\f$ and \f$ Q \f$ by \f$ \Omega^2 = (\rho_{\rm solid}/\rho_{\rm fluid}) Q\f$.
We therefore provide a helper function to update the dependent parameter
following any change in the independent parameters.

\until }

We force the system by imposing a prescribed displacement
on the inner surface of the elastic coating and allow this to vary
in the "zenith"-direction with wavenumber \f$ M \f$:

studies.

the solution of the time-harmonic elasticity and Helmholtz
equations.

\subsection class The problem class

The \c Problem class is templated by the types of the
"bulk" elements used to discretise the Fourier-decomposed 
time-harmonic linear elasticity and Helmholtz equations,
respectively. It contains the  usual member functions to attach 
\c FaceElements to the bulk meshes in order to apply the
various Neumann boundary conditions. We note that the costly 
recomputation of the \f$ \gamma- \f$ integral in the
Dirichlet-to-Neumann mapping before the Newton convergence check 
(implemented in \c actions_before_newton_convergence_check())
can be avoided by declaring the problem to be linear;

\subsection constr The problem constructor
We start by building the meshes for the elasticity and Helmholtz
equations. Both domains are half annular regions, so the
annular mesh (which is built from a rectangular \c QuadMesh)
is not periodic but only occupies 180 degrees. The mesh also needs to 
be rotated by 90 degrees to align its ends with the \f$ z- \f$ axis:


\dontinclude fourier_decomposed_acoustic_fsi.cc
\skipline start_of_constructor
\until phi=

The solid mesh occupies the region between \f$ r = 1-h \f$ and \f$ r=1
\f$ where \f$ h \f$ is the thickness of the elastic coating:

\until H_coating,phi);


The Helmholtz mesh occupies the region between \f$ r = 1 \f$ and \f$
r=R_{\rm outer} \f$ where \f$ R_{\rm outer}\f$ is the outer radius of 
the computational domain where we will apply the Sommerfeld radiation 
condition. Note that the two meshes are not matching -- both meshes
have 3 element layers in the radial direction but 10 and 11
in the azimuthal direction, respectively. This is done mainly 
to illustrate our claim that the multi-domain setup functions
can operate with non-matching meshes.

\until h_thick_helmholtz,phi);

Next we create the mesh that will store the \c FaceElements that
will apply the Sommerfeld radiation condition, using the specified
number of Fourier terms in the Dirichlet-to-Neumann mapping;
see the <a href="../../../fourier_decomposed_helmholtz/sphere_scattering/html/index.html#DtN">Helmholtz
tutorial</a> for details.
 
\until nfourier);

Next we pass the problem parameters to the bulk elements. The
elasticity elements require a pointer to Poisson's ratio, \f$ \nu \f$, the
azimuthal (Fourier) wavenumber \f$ N \f$, and the frequency parameter 
\f$ \Omega^2 \f$:

\until }

The Helmholtz elements need a pointer to the (square of the)
wavenumber, \f$ k^2 \f$ and the azimuthal (Fourier) wavenumber \f$ N \f$:

\until }

It is always a good idea to check the enumeration of the mesh
boundaries to facilitate the application of boundary conditions:

\until helmholtz_mesh_boundary.dat

Next we create the meshes containing the various \c FaceElements
used to apply to the FSI traction boundary condition
(@R[fsi_for_solid]@), the FSI flux boundary condition (@R[fsi_for_fluid]@)
for the Helmholtz equation, and the Sommerfeld radiation condition 
(@R[sommerfeld]@), respectively, using helper functions discussed
below.

\until build_global_mesh();

The solid displacements are prescribed on the inner boundary
(boundary 0) of the solid mesh so we pin all six values 
(representing the real and imaginary parts of the displacements
in the \f$ r-, z- \f$ and \f$ \varphi- \f$  directions, respectively)
and assign the boundary values using the function \c
Global_Parameters::solid_boundary_displacement(...).
(The enumeration of the unknowns in the Fourier-decomposed 
equations time-harmonic linear elasticity is discussed in 
<a href="../../../time_harmonic_fourier_decomposed_linear_elasticity/cylinder/html/index.html#element_types">another tutorial</a>.)

The radial and azimuthal displacements have to vanish on the
symmetry boundary (boundaries 1 and 3):

Finally, we set up the fluid-structure interaction, assign the
equation numbers and open a trace
file to record the radiated power as a function of the FSI
parameter \f$ Q \f$.

\subsection create_flux Creating the FSI traction elements (and the FSI flux and DtN elements) 
The function \c create_fsi_traction_elements() creates the \c FaceElements
required to apply the FSI traction boundary condition
(@R[fsi_for_solid]@) on the outer boundary (boundary 2) of the solid
mesh:

\dontinclude fourier_decomposed_acoustic_fsi.cc

To function properly, the elements need to know the number of the
bulk mesh boundary they are attached to (this allows them to
determine the boundary coordinate \f$ \zeta \f$ required to
set up the fluid-structure interaction; see \ref impl ), and
the FSI parameter \f$ Q \f$.

\until end_of_create_fsi_traction_elements


[\b Note: We omit the listings of the functions
\c create_helmholtz_fsi_flux_elements() and 
\c create_helmholtz_DtN_elements()
which create the \c FaceElements
required to apply the FSI flux boundary condition
(@R[fsi_for_fluid]@) on the inner boundary (boundary 0),

\subsection fsi Setting up the fluid-structure interaction
The setup of the fluid-structure interaction requires 
the identification of the "bulk" Helmholtz elements that are 
adjacent to (the Gauss points of) the \c FaceElements 
that impose the FSI traction boundary condition (@R[fsi_for_solid]@),
in terms of the displacement potential \f$ \phi \f$ computed by these
"bulk" elements. This can be done using the helper function
\c Multi_domain_functions::setup_bulk_elements_adjacent_to_face_mesh(...)
which is templated by the type of the "bulk" element and its spatial
dimension, and takes as arguments:
- a pointer to the \c Problem, 
- the boundary ID of the FSI boundary in the "bulk" mesh,

- The application of the Sommerfeld radiation condition via 
  a Dirichlet-to-Neumann mapping is discussed in detail 
  in <a  href="../../../fourier_decomposed_helmholtz/sphere_scattering/html/index.html#DtN">another
  tutorial.</a> We explain there that, because the \f$ \gamma \f$
  integral depends on the solution, 
  it must be recomputed whenever the unknowns are updated during
  the Newton iteration. This is best done by adding a call to
  \c FourierDecomposedHelmholtzDtNMesh::setup_gamma() to 
  \c Problem::actions_before_newton_convergence_check() as done in the
  driver code listed above.
  However, if Helmholtz's equation is solved in isolation (or within
  a coupled, but linear problem as in the present case ), the
  Newton method is guaranteed to converge 
  in one iteration. In such cases the unnecessary recomputation of 
  \f$ \gamma \f$ after the one-and-only Newton iteration can be 
  suppressed by setting \c Problem::Problem_is_nonlinear to 
  \c false -- in that case, \c oomph-lib's Newton solver
  skips the convergence check in the Newton iteration and simply
  accepts the solution obtained after one linear solve.
- You may have noticed that, unlike the tutorial for the
  <a href="../../../acoustic_fsi/acoustic_fsi_annulus/html/index.html">
  cartesian counterpart</a> of the model problem considered here, we
  neither demonstrate how to apply the Sommerfeld radiation condition
  by approximate/absorbing boundary conditions (ABCs), nor do we 
  demonstrate the use of spatial adaptivity.
  This is because the relevant elements have not (yet!) been written
  (Any volunteers?). If you wish to enable spatial adaptivity we
  suggest using an unstructured adaptive mesh, using the methodology 
  demonstrated in 
  <a  href="../../../fourier_decomposed_acoustic_fsi/unstructured_sphere/html/index.html#DtN">another tutorial.</a>

\subsection ex Exercises
- As shown in the \ref appendix, the time-averaged radiated power 
  \f$ \overline{\cal P}\f$ depends 
  on the derivatives of the displacement potential \f$ \phi \f$. This
  implies that the value for \f$ \overline{\cal P}\f$ computed from the
  finite-element solution for \f$ \phi \f$ is not
  as accurate as the displacement potential itself. Computing
  \f$ \overline{\cal P}\f$ to a certain tolerance (e.g. to 
  "graphical accuracy" as in the plot shown above) therefore tends to
  require meshes that are much finer than would be required
  if we were only interested in \f$ \phi \f$ itself.
  \n\n
  Investigate the accuracy of the computational predictions for \f$
  \overline{\cal P}\f$ by:
  - increasing the spatial resolution e.g. by using
    the command line flag \c --el_multiplier which controls the number
    of elements in the mesh.
  - reducing the outer radius of the computational domain, using
    the command line flag \c --outer_radius, say.
  - varying the element type, from the bi-linear 
    \c QFourierDecomposedHelmholtzElement<2>
    to the bi-cubic \c QFourierDecomposedHelmholtzElement<4>, say.
  .
 Which of these approaches gives you the "most accuracy" for a given number of
 degrees of freedom?

\section appendix Appendix: The time-averaged radiated power
This appendix provides a brief summary of the computation (and
non-dimensionalisation) of the time-averaged power 
\f$ \overline{\cal P }^* \f$ radiated across the closed surface
\f$ \partial V \f$ (with outer unit normal  \f$ {\bf n} \f$) 
of a fluid volume \f$ V \f$.
In dimensional terms, \f$ \overline{\cal P }^* \f$ is given by
\f[
\overline{\cal P }^* = \oint_{\partial V} I^* dA^*, 
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ @E[power]@
\f]
where the intensity 
\f[
I^* =  \frac{1}{{\cal T}} \int_0^{\cal T} 
{\bf U}^* \cdot P^* {\bf n}  \
dt^* 
\f] 
depends on the fluid velocity \f$ {\bf U}^* =
\partial {\bf d}^*/\partial t^* = \partial/\partial t^* (\nabla^*
\Phi^*) \f$ and the pressure \f$ P^* = \rho_{\rm f} \omega^2 \Phi^* \f$. 
The time average is taken over the period of the oscillation,
\f$ {\cal T} = 2\pi/\omega. \f$ Using our time-periodic ansatz 
for the fluid displacement potential, \f$ \Phi^* = 
Re\{ \phi^* \exp(-{\rm i}\omega t^*) \} \f$, the intensity can
be re-written as
\f[
I^* = \frac{1}{2} \rho_{\rm f} \omega^3 
\bigg( Im \{\frac{\partial \phi^*}{\partial n^*} \} Re\{\phi^* \} -
      Re \{\frac{\partial \phi^*}{\partial n^*} \} Im\{\phi^* \} 
\bigg).
\f] 
Next we express the surface integral in (@R[power]@) in
cylindrical polar coordinates. Assuming the (axisymmetric)
boundary of the fluid domain is parametrised (in the \f$
(r^*,z^*)\f$ plane) as 
\f$ r^* = R^*(s^*)\f$ and \f$ z^* = Z^*(s^*)\f$, where \f$ s^* \f$
is some curve parameter (e.g. the arclength), we have
\f[
\overline{\cal P }^* = \int \int_0^{2\pi} I^*(s^*,\varphi) 
\sqrt{ \left(\frac{\partial R^*}{\partial s^*}\right)^2 +
       \left(\frac{\partial Z^*}{\partial s^*}\right)^2 }
       R^*(s^*) \ d\varphi \  ds^* 
\f]
The power associated with the \f$ N-\f$th azimuthal Fourier mode,
\f$ \phi^*_N(r^*,z^*) \exp({\rm i}N \varphi) \f$, is then given by
\f[
\overline{\cal P }^*_N = \pi \rho_{\rm f} \omega^3  \int 
\bigg( Im \{\frac{\partial \phi_N^*}{\partial n^*} \} Re\{\phi_N^* \} -
       Re \{\frac{\partial \phi_N^*}{\partial n^*} \} Im\{\phi_N^* \} 
\bigg)
\sqrt{ \left(\frac{\partial R^*}{\partial s^*}\right)^2 +
       \left(\frac{\partial Z^*}{\partial s^*}\right)^2 }
       R^*(s^*) \  ds^*.
\f]
Non-dimensionalising all lengths on \f$ {\cal L}\f$ and the
displacement potential on \f$ {\cal L}^2 \f$ then yields the
following expression for the non-dimensional time-averaged radiated power
\f[
\overline{\cal P }_N = 
\frac{\overline{\cal P }^*_N}{\rho_{\rm f} \omega^3 {\cal L}^5}
=  \pi \int 
\bigg( Im \{\frac{\partial \phi_N}{\partial n} \} Re\{\phi_N \} -
       Re \{\frac{\partial \phi_N}{\partial n} \} Im\{\phi_N \} 
\bigg)
\sqrt{ \left(\frac{\partial R}{\partial s}\right)^2 +
       \left(\frac{\partial Z}{\partial s}\right)^2 }
       R(s) \  ds.
\f]
This quantity is computed by \c oomph-lib on an element-by-element
basis, using the function
\c FourierDecomposedHelmholtzBCElementBase::global_power_contribution(...).

The computation is most easily validated by comparing against
analytical results in which the displacement potential is expressed
in spherical polar coordinates \f$ (r_{\rm sphere}^*, \theta, \varphi)
\f$ where \f$ r_{\rm sphere}^* = \sqrt{r^{*2} + z^{*2}} \f$ and
\f$ \theta \f$ is the zenith angle which varies from \f$ \theta=0\f$ at
the "North pole" to \f$ \theta=\pi \f$ at the "South pole".
If we evaluate the surface integral in (@R[power]@) 
on a spherical surface of dimensional radius \f$ a^* \f$, the dimensional
time-averaged radiated power is
\f[
\overline{\cal P }^* = \int_0^\pi \int_0^{2\pi} I^*(r_{\rm sphere}^*=a^*,
\theta,\varphi)\  a^{*2} \sin(\theta) \ d\varphi \ d\theta.
\f]
The power associated with \f$ N-\f$th azimuthal Fourier mode,
\f$ \phi^*_N(r^*,z^*) \exp({\rm i}N \varphi) \f$, is then given by
\f[
\overline{\cal P }^*_N = \pi a^{*2} \rho_{\rm f} \omega^3  \int_0^\pi 
\left.\bigg( Im \{\frac{\partial \phi_N^*}{\partial n^*} \} Re\{\phi_N^* \} -
       Re \{\frac{\partial \phi_N^*}{\partial n^*} \} Im\{\phi_N^* \} 
\bigg)\right|_{r_{\rm sphere}^*=a^*}
\sin(\theta) \ d\theta,
\f]
where \f$ \partial / \partial n^* = \partial / \partial r_{\rm
sphere}^* \f$. The non-dimensional time-averaged power, evaluated
on a sphere of non-dimensional radius \f$ a = a^*/{\cal L}\f$ is then
given by
\f[
\overline{\cal P }_N = 
\frac{\overline{\cal P }^*_N}{\rho_{\rm f} \omega^3 {\cal L}^5}
=  \pi a^2 \int_0^\pi 
\left.
\bigg( Im \{\frac{\partial \phi_N}{\partial n} \} Re\{\phi_N \} -
       Re \{\frac{\partial \phi_N}{\partial n} \} Im\{\phi_N \} 
\bigg)\right|_{r_{\rm sphere}=a} \sin(\theta) \ d\theta,
\f]
where \f$ \partial / \partial n = \partial / \partial r_{\rm
sphere} \f$.

The derivation of the analytical expression for 
\f$ \overline{\cal P }_N \f$
against which we validated our computational results were performed
with maple, using the script
