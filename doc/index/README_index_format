1. The basic format of the oomph.idx file is 

Tag @ %link.html @end

The % is a tag to indicate that it is a link and is converted to 
 $(top_builddir)/doc/link.html

2. The tags can be nested

Tag1 @ Tag2 @ %link2.html @end

3. Cross references are indicated by a ^

 Tag1 @ ^Other_Tag @end

4. In order to cross-reference over several levels you can use the tags
separated by dots

Main link @ sublink @ %link.html @end

Synonym @ ^Main link.sublink @end

5. You may like to know that all entries are given html anchors which can be 
accessed by removing all spaces, replacing @ with . and putting the first 
letter of the main tag first

Main link @ sublink @ %link.html @end

 can be accessed directly by

 ($top_builddir)/doc/index.html#M.Mainlink.sublink
