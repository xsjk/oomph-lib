\mainpage Document index

The purpose of this document is to provide a means of navigating
around the \c oomph-lib documentation. The documentation is
presented through a series of example codes which is fine if you know
which type of problem you want to solve. In that case you can go
directly to the appropriate section of the 
<a href="../../example_code_list/html/index.html"> list of example
  codes. </a> If you want to learn about general concept rather than a
  specific type of problem
  then it can be more difficult to find the appropriate
documentation. In this index, both general concepts and specific 
types of problem are arranged alphabetically with hyperlinks to the
  appropriate documents.
