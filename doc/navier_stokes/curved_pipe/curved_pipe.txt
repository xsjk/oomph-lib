\mainpage Example problem: Steady flow in a curved tube 

 The problem of steady flow in a curved tube is 
 considered with a prescribed Poiseuille flow at the inlet 
 and a traction-free outlet condition. It is
 not clear that the latter is appropriate, but the main aim of this example is
 to check that the \c TubeMesh works correctly. 

 A detailed comparison between the flow field and the Dean solution should
 be performed for validation purposes, but the qualitative features seem
 reasonable.
