advection-diffusion problem

Solve
\f[
\mbox{Pe}\ \sum_{i=1}^2 w_i \left(x_1,x_2\right) \frac{\partial u}{\partial
x_i} = \sum_{i=1}^2 \frac{\partial^2u}{\partial x_i^2} + f(x_1,x_2), 
 \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ @E[2DPoisson]@
\f]
in the rectangular domain \f$D =\left\{ (x_1,x_2) \in 
[0,1] \times [0,2]\right\}\f$, 
with Dirichlet boundary conditions
\f[
\left. u\right|_{\partial D}=u_0,
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ @E[2DPoisson_BC]@
\f]

where the \e Peclet \e number, \f$ \mbox{Pe} \f$ the boundary values, 
\f$ u_0\f$, the source function \f$ f(x_1,x_2),\f$  
and the components of the  "wind" \f$ w_i(x_1,x_2) \ (i=1,2)\f$ are given. 
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>  
</CENTER>  

We set \f$ f(x_1,x_2)=0\f$ and assign the boundary conditions such that 
\f[
u_0(x_1,x_2) = \tanh(1-\alpha(x_1 \tan\Phi - x_2)),
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \  @E[ExactSoln]@
\f]
For large values of \f$ \alpha, \f$ 
this boundary data approaches a step, oriented at an angle
\f$\Phi\f$ against the \f$x_1-\f$axis.


 In the computations we will impose the "wind"
\f[
\mathbf{w}\left(x_1,x_2 \right) = 
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
\sin(6x_2) \\
 \cos(6x_1)
\end{array}
\right),
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \  @E[WindFct]@
\f]
illustrated in this vector plot:

@I w 0.75\textwidth wind "Plot of the wind. "


The figures below show plots of the solution for 
\f$\Phi=45^\circ, \ \alpha=50 \f$ 
and a Peclet number of \f$ Pe = 200\f$, with and without SUPG
stabilisation. The wire-mesh plot shows the solution computed
on a 10x10 mesh, the shaded surface represents the solution
obtained from an unstabilised solution on a 150x150 mesh. 
Note how SUPG stabilisation "suppresses the wiggles" on the 
relatively coarse mesh.

\section main The driver code

Overall, the structure of the driver code is very similar to 
that used for the <A HREF="../../../advection_diffusion/two_d_adv_diff_adapt/html/index.html">
problem without stabilisation</a>. 

\subsection todo To be written:
- Discuss SUPG theory.
- Implementation and the role of basis, shape and test functions
  (our equations are isoparametric) 
.
Until we get around to completing this example, here's the driver
code. Fairly self-explanatory, isn't it?
