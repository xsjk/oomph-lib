\mainpage Example problem: Adaptive solution of the 2D advection diffusion equation with flux boundary conditions

In this problem we will discuss the 2D advection-diffusion problem
with Neumann (flux) boundary conditions, using \c oomph-lib's 
mesh adaptation routines.

Solve
\f[
\mbox{Pe}\ \sum_{i=1}^2 w_i \left(x_1,x_2 \right) \frac{\partial u}{\partial
x_i} = \sum_{i=1}^2 \frac{\partial^2u}{\partial x_i^2} + f(x_1,x_2), 
 \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ @E[2DPoisson]@
\f]
in the rectangular domain \f$D =\left\{ (x_1,x_2) \in 
[0,1] \times [0,2]\right\}\f$. We split the domain boundary \f$
\partial D \f$ into two parts so that
\f$ \partial D = \partial D_{Neumann} \cup \partial D_{Dirichlet} \f$,
where \f$ \partial D_{Neumann} 
= \left\{ (x_1,x_2) | x_1=1, \ x_2\in [0,2] \right\} \f$.
On \f$ \partial D_{Dirichlet}\f$ we apply the Dirichlet boundary conditions
\f[
\left. u\right|_{\partial D_{Dirichlet}}=u_0,
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ @E[2DPoisson_BC]@
\f]
where the function \f$ u_0 \f$ is given. On  \f$ \partial D_{Neumann}\f$
we apply the Neumann conditions 
\f[
\left. \frac{\partial u}{\partial n}\right|_{\partial D_{Neumann}} = 
\left. \frac{\partial u}{\partial x_1}\right|_{\partial D_{Neumann}}
=g_0,
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ @E[2DPoisson_fluxBC]@
\f]
where the function \f$ g_0 \f$ is given.

As always, we validate the code by choosing the  boundary data and the
source functions such that 
\f[
u(x_1,x_2) = \tanh(1-\alpha(x_1 \tan\Phi - x_2)),
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \  @E[ExactSoln]@
\f]
is the exact solution of the problem.
The plot below shows the numerical solution for \f$\Phi=45^\circ \f$,
a Peclet number of \f$\mbox{Pe}= 200 \f$, and four 
different values of the "steepness parameter", 
\f$ \alpha =  0.2,\ 5,\ 10 \f$ and \f$ 15 \f$. 

@I w 0.75\textwidth step_soln "Animation of the adaptive solution for various values of the `steepness parameter'. "

As in the  <A HREF="../../two_d_adv_diff_adapt/html/index.html">example 
with Dirichlet boundary conditions</A>, the unforced case is a lot 
more interesting. The plot below shows the result for a zero source function
\f$ f \equiv 0 \f$, Dirichlet boundary conditions determined from
the "exact solution" of the forced problem for \f$ \alpha = 15\f$,
and a prescribed flux of \f$ g_0 = -1 \f$ on \f$ \partial D_{Neumann}\f$.


@I w 0.75\textwidth no_source "Plot of the adaptive solution of the unforced problem. "

Along \f$ \partial D_{Dirichlet}\f$, the value of \f$ u \f$ is enforced
by the Dirichlet boundary condition (@R[2DPoisson_BC]@) and,
as in the  <A HREF="../../two_d_adv_diff_adapt/html/index.html">
previous example</A>, the "wind" either sweeps this value into the
interior of the domain or creates a sharp boundary layer within
which the solution that is "swept" along from the interior adjusts itself
to the prescribed boundary value. Along \f$ \partial D_{Neumann}\f$, the
flux boundary condition  (@R[2DPoisson_fluxBC]@) imposes the normal
derivative of the solution. This boundary condition is much
"softer" than the Dirichlet condition and does not create boundary
layers that are as sharp as the ones that develop on 
 \f$ \partial D_{Dirichlet}\f$.

\section code The driver code
The <A HREF="../../../../demo_drivers/advection_diffusion/two_d_adv_diff_flux_bc/two_d_adv_diff_flux_bc.cc">driver
code</A> for this problem is so similar to the 
<A HREF="../../../poisson/two_d_poisson_flux_bc_adapt/html/index.html">
corresponding Poisson problem</A> that we do not list it here.
The modifications are the same as those discussed
in the  <A HREF="../../two_d_adv_diff_adapt/html/index.html">
advection diffusion problem with Dirichlet boundary conditions:</A>
We have to specify the wind function and the Peclet number.
