\mainpage Thermoelasticity: Combining the Heat equation and non-linear Solid Mechanics

@I w 0.75\textwidth undef "Undeformed configuration of an elastic block. " 

 We consider the uniform steady thermal expansion of an elastic
 body that is differentially heated. The top surface is heated and the bottom
 surface is maintained at the reference temperature, which leads to
 a uniform temperature gradient throughout the material. The material
 expands more near the upper surface than near the lower surface, deforming
 the initially rectangular block into an curved configuration.
