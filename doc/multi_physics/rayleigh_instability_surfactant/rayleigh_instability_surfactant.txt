\mainpage The Rayleigh--Plateau instability in the presence of an insoluble surfactant

In this tutorial we present an example of surface-transport equations
in a free-surface Navier--Stokes problem. This is a multi-domain, multi-physics
problem because there is a coupling between the equations on
the surface and those in the bulk. The coupling from the bulk to the
surface transport arises through the surface velocity in the surface
transport equation. The coupling from the surface transport to bulk arises in a
more subtle manner because the surface concentration affects the
surface tension. In this tutorial, we describe how to use 
the existing framework to create surface transport equations and 
how to include them in a free-surface problem.

\section example_problem The example problem

The problem to be solved is the evolution of an annular film of fluid
on the inside of a solid cylinder in the presence of an insoluble surfactant
on the interface: a modification of the classic Rayleigh--Plateau
instability. For validation, we reproduce some of the results given in `A 2-D 
model of Rayleigh instability in capillary tubes --- surfactant 
effects' by D. Campana, J. Di Paolo & F. A. Saita, <em> Int. J. Multiphase Flow,
</em> vol <b> 30 </b>, pp 431--454, (2004). Our formulation, however,
is different from their approach as described in detail in our 
<a href="../../../navier_stokes/surface_theory/html/index.html">
free-surface theory document. </a>

The

on the bottom (\f$ z = 0.0 \f$) and top (\f$ z = \pi / \alpha \f$)
boundaries.

We denote the position vector to the free surface
by \f$ \mathbf{R} \f$, which is subject to the kinematic condition
\f[
\left(u_i - St\, \frac{\partial R_i}{\partial t}\right) n_i = 0,

+ \frac{\partial \sigma}{\partial s} t_{i} \right).
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ @E[eqn:dynamicBC]@
\f]
where \f$ \sigma = \sigma^{*} / \sigma_{ref} \f$ is the dimensionless
surface tension relative to a reference value.

An insoluble surfactant of surface concentration \f$ \Gamma^{*}\f$ is
 non-dimensionalised with respect to a reference value \f$ \Gamma =
 \Gamma^{*}/\Gamma_{ref} \f$ and obeys the surface transport equation
 \f[ St \left(\frac{\partial \Gamma}{\partial t} -
   \dot{\mbox{\boldmath$R$}} \mbox{\boldmath$\cdot$} 
   \mbox{\boldmath$\nabla$}_{\!\!_{S}} \Gamma \right) +
   \mbox{\boldmath$\nabla$}_{\!\!_{S}} \mbox{\boldmath$\cdot$} 
   \left(\Gamma \mbox{\boldmath$U$}\right) =
   \frac{1}{Pe_{s}}
 \mbox{\boldmath$\nabla$}_{\!\!_{S}}\mbox{\boldmath$\cdot$}
 \mbox{\boldmath$\nabla$}_{\!\!_{S}}
   \Gamma  \f]
on the interface.

The surface tension is a function of the surfactant concentration \f$
\sigma(\Gamma)\f$ and a linear equation of state is chosen 
\f[ \sigma = 1 - \beta (\Gamma - 1).
 \f]

The symmetry boundary conditions on the bottom (\f$ z = 0.0 \f$) and
top (\f$ z = \pi / \alpha \f$) boundaries are
 \f[ \frac{\partial \Gamma}{\partial z} = 0. \f]

Initially, the system is at rest and \f$ \Gamma =1 \f$. The free
surface is moved into the position:
\f[
 \mathbf{R} = \left[1.0 - H*(1.0 + \epsilon\cos \left(\alpha z\right)
 \right] \mbox{\boldmath$e$}_{r} \f] 
where \f$ \epsilon \f$ is a small parameter and \f$ H\f$ is the
undeformed film thickness.

\section results Results

We choose parameters based on those used to compute Figures 8 and 9 in
Campana et al; namely \f$ H = 0.2 \f$, \f$ Re = 40 \f$, \f$ St = 1\f$,
\f$ Ca = H^{3} \f$, \f$ \alpha = 1.047 \f$, \f$ \epsilon = 10^{-3}\f$,
\f$ \beta = 3.6 \times 10^{-3} \f$ and
\f$Pe_{S} = 4032\f$. For these parameters, the system is unstable
to the Rayleigh--Plateau instability and evolves towards a state in
which the tube is completely occluded by the fluid at one end.

\section main The driver code and problem class
 
 The driver code and problem are very similar to those in the 
 <a href="../../../navier_stokes/single_layer_free_surface/html/index.html">
 two-dimensional </a> and <a href="../../../axisym_navier_stokes/two_layer_interface_axisym/html/index.html">
 axisymmetric </a>
 interface-relaxation problems on which this driver was based.
  The main difference between this problem and standard free surface
 problems is that instead of  
 oomph::SpineAxisymmetricFluidInterfaceElement, we use the custom 
 oomph::SpineAxisymmetricMarangoniSurfactantFluidInterfaceElement.
 The symmetry boundary conditions for the surface concentration are
 the natural boundary conditions of our formulation, so we "do
 nothing" for the additional field at the boundaries.
 
 An additional member function \c
 InterfaceProblem::compute_total_mass() is provided as a check on the
 implementation of the the surface transport equations. The surfactant
 cannot be removed from the surface, so its mass must be
 conserved. The function simply loops over the interface elements and
 sums their contribution to the total mass.

 \skipline Compute the total mass

\section element The SpineAxisymmetricMarangoniSurfactantFluidInterfaceElement class

 This class is implemented in our driver code and inherits directly
 from oomph::SpineAxisymmetricFluidInterfaceElement. The class
 provides storage for the required additional dimensionless groups
 and the nodal index where the surface concentration will be stored.
 \dontinclude rayleigh_instability_insoluble_surfactant.cc
 \skipline Spine-based Marangoni
 \until C_index
 
 Most of the functionality is already provided by the underlying \c
 FluidInterfaceElement and we need simply to overload a few
 functions. The constructor sets default values for the physical constants
 and adds the additional data value to nodes on the surface.
 \skipline Constructor
 \until }
 
 The function \c FluidInterfaceElement::sigma() is
 overloaded using the equation of state defined in the problem specification

 The majority of the work is performed in 
 \skipline add_additional
 \until {
  which provides the additional surface transport equations. In the
 example code two formulations of the surface transport equations are
 provided the one used by Campana et al in which the curvature is
 computed explicitly and the formulation derived in our <a href="../../../navier_stokes/surface_theory/html/index.html">
free-surface theory, </a> in which the curvature is not required. The
 version used is determined by an internal boolean
 \until Integrated_curvature
 The remainder of the function adds the residuals associated with the
 surfactant transport equations which are described in the 
 <a href="../../../navier_stokes/surface_theory/html/index.html">
 free-surface theory. </a> Note that an additional term arises due to
 the azimuthal curvature compared to the standard one-dimensional
 surface.

 The function \c fill_in_contribution_to_jacobian(...) is also
 overloaded to that the effect of surfactant concentration on the bulk
 equations is computed by finite differences. This could be modified
 in the future so that the appropriate derivative terms are included
 in \c add_additional_residual_contributions_interface(...).

 Finally the elements contain a function
 \skipline integrate_c()
 \until const
 that computes the integral of the concentration over the elemental
 surface, representing the total mass of surfactant within the
 element.

\subsection exercises Exercises
-# Investigate the difference between the solutions for the two
formulations of the surfactant transport equations. Which conserves
mass more accurately?
   \n\n
-# Investigate the influence of variations in \f$\beta\f$ and try to
reproduce the results found by Campana et al.
-# Look at the three-dimensional (non-axisymmetric) version of the
code found in the same directory. Confirm that the same results are
produced. Is the instability stable to non-axisymmetric perturbations?
Use the code to investigate what happens if you make the cross-sectional 
boundary slightly elliptical rather than circular?
