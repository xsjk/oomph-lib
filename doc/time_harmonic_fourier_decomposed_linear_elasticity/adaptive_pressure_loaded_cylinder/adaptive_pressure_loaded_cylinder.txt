\mainpage The spatially-adaptive solution of the azimuthally Fourier-decomposed equations of 3D time-harmonic linear elasticity on unstructured meshes

In this tutorial we re-visit the solution of the
time-harmonic equations of 3D linear elasticity in cylindrical polar
coordinates, using a Fourier decomposition of the solution in the 
azimuthal direction. The driver code is very similar to the one discussed in 
<a href="../../cylinder/html/index.html">another tutorial
</a> -- the main purpose of the current tutorial is to demonstrate
the use of spatial adaptivity on unstructured meshes. Compared to
the test case considered in the <a href="../../cylinder/html/index.html">
other tutorial</a> we study a slightly less contrived test problem:
the forced time-harmonic oscillations of a finite-length, hollow cylinder,
loaded by a time-periodic pressure load on its inner surface.

\section test The test problem
The figure below shows the problem considered in this tutorial:
an annular elastic body that occupies the region \f$ r_{\rm min}\leq
r\leq r_{\rm max}, z_{\rm min}\leq
z\leq z_{\rm max} \f$ is loaded by 
a time-harmonic pressure load acting on its inner surface 
(at \f$ r = r_{\rm min} \f$). The upper and lower ends of the
hollow cylinder (at \f$ z = z_{\rm min} \f$ and \f$ z = z_{\rm min} \f$)
are held at a fixed position.

Here is an animation of the resulting displacement field
for \f$ r_{\rm min} = 0.1 \f$ and  \f$ r_{\rm max} = 1.1. \f$


@I w 0.6\textwidth anim "Forced oscillations of a thick-walled, hollow cylinder, subject to a pressure load on its inner surface. The pink shape in the background shows the cylinder's undeformed shape (in a radial plane); the mesh plotted in the region r < 0 illustrates how spatial adaptivity refines the mesh in regions of sharp displacement gradients (near the loaded surface and the supports).

\section num The numerical solution
The driver code for this problem is very similar to the one discussed in
<a href=../../cylinder/html/index.html>another tutorial</a>.

shows you the differences, the most important of which are:
- The change of the forcing to a spatially constant 
  pressure load on the inside boundary.
- The provision of the \c actions_before/after_adapt() functions and a 
  helper function \c complete_problem_setup()
  which rebuilds the elements (by passing the problem parameters
  to the elements) following the unstructured mesh adaptation.
  (The need/rationale for such a function is discussed in 
  <a href="../../../meshes/mesh_from_inline_triangle/html/index.html">
  another tutorial.</a>)
- The mesh generation and the application of boundary conditions at
  the upper and lower boundaries of the hollow cylinder.
.  
All of this is reasonably straightforward and provides a
powerful code that automatically adapts the mesh in regions of 
large displacement gradients. Have a look through the driver code 
and play with it.
