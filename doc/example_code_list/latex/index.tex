\hypertarget{index}{}\label{index}\index{Example codes and Tutorials@{Example codes and Tutorials}}
This document provides a complete list of the example codes that are distributed with the {\ttfamily oomph-\/lib} library. For each code we give a brief description of the problem solved and provide a link to the detailed documentation. The codes are listed in order of increasing complexity. The bullet-\/point list in the right column lists the new {\ttfamily oomph-\/lib} features that are introduced in the example. You may either work through the examples one-\/by-\/one, treating the example codes and their documentation as chapters in a self-\/study course, or use the list of topics in the right column as a quick reference to example codes that provide an introduction to a specific feature.

You may also wish to consult the following documents\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The \href{../../intro/html/index.html}{\texttt{ Introduction }} provides a "{}low tech"{} review of the theory of finite elements and presents a "{}top-\/down"{} discussion of the method\textquotesingle{}s implementation within {\ttfamily oomph-\/lib}.
\item The document \href{../../the_data_structure/html/index.html}{\texttt{ The Data Structure }} provides a "{}bottom-\/up"{} discussion of {\ttfamily oomph-\/lib\textquotesingle{}s} data structure.
\item The \href{../../quick_guide/html/index.html}{\texttt{ (Not-\/\+So-\/)Quick Guide}} provides a "{}quick"{} introduction on how to create new instances of {\ttfamily oomph-\/lib\textquotesingle{}s} fundamental objects\+: {\ttfamily Problems}, {\ttfamily Meshes}, and {\ttfamily Elements}.

 We\textquotesingle{}re still working on the detailed documentation for many of the demo problems listed below. The fully-\/documented demo problems are accessible via the links. If you are particularly interested in a specific problem for which the detailed documentation is incomplete, let us know -- we might be able to give it a slightly higher priority. We are happy to let you have driver codes before the documentation is complete. Such codes usually need a bit of tidying to make them acceptable for "{}general release"{}, but they are fully functional. In fact, they are run on a regular basis as part of {\ttfamily  oomph-\/lib\textquotesingle{}s } self-\/test routines (activated by typing {\ttfamily  make check } in the top-\/level directory).    \\\cline{1-1}
