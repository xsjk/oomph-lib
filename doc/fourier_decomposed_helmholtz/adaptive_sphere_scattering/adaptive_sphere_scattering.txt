\mainpage Example problem: The spatially-adaptive solution of the azimuthally Fourier-decomposed 3D Helmholtz equation


In this document we discuss the spatially-adaptive
finite-element-based solution of the 3D
Helmholtz equation in cylindrical polar coordinates, using a
Fourier-decomposition of the solution in the azimuthal direction.

The driver code is very similar to the one discussed in 
<a href="../../sphere_scattering/html/index.html">another tutorial
</a> -- the main purpose of the current tutorial is to demonstrate
the use of spatial adaptivity on unstructured meshes.

\section scattering A specific example
We will solve the azimuthally Fourier-decomposed Helmholtz equation 
\f[
\nabla^2 {u_{N}}(r,z) + \left(k^2-\frac{N^2}{r^2}\right) u_N(r,z) = 0,
 \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ @E[fourier_helmholtz]@
\f]
where \f$ N \f$ is the azimuthal wavenumber, 
in the finite domain \f$ 1 < \sqrt{r^2 + z^2} < 3 \f$. 
We impose the Sommerfeld radiation condition at the outer boundary 
of the computational domain at \f$ \sqrt{r^2 + z^2} = 3\f$, 
using a Dirichlet-to-Neumann mapping, and apply flux boundary condition 
on the surface of the unit-sphere (where \f$ \sqrt{r^2 + z^2} = 1 \f$)
such that the exact solution is given by 
\f[
u_N(r,z)=u_N^{[exact]}(r,z)=\sum_{l=N}^{N_{\rm terms}} 
h_{l}^{(1)}(k\sqrt{r^2+z^2}) \ P_{l}^{N}\left(\frac{z}{\sqrt{r^2+z^2}}\right).
\f]
This solution corresponds to the superposition of several outgoing 
waves that emerge from the unit sphere.

The two plots below show a comparison between the exact and computed
solutions for \f$ N_{\rm terms}=6 \f$ , a Fourier wavenumber 
of \f$ N=1 \f$ , and a (squared) Helmholtz wavenumber of \f$ k^2 = 10 \f$.

shows the main differences required to discretise the computational
domain with an adaptive, unstructured mesh:
- The provision of the functions \c actions_before/after_adapt() to 
  detach/re-attach the \c FaceElements that are used to enforce 
  the Neumann boundary conditions before and after every spatial
  adaptation, and to pass the physical parameters to the newly
  created bulk elements.
  \n\n
- The generation of an unstructured mesh whose curvilinear boundaries are
  represented by \c GeomObjects -- this ensures that the domain boundaries
  become increasingly well resolved under mesh refinement.

That's all!
