Here are the classes, structs, unions and interfaces with brief descriptions\+:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{classShellMesh}{Shell\+Mesh$<$ ELEMENT $>$}} \\*A 2D Mesh class. The tube wall is represented by two Lagrangian coordinates that correspond to z and theta in cylindrical polars. The required mesh is therefore a 2D mesh and is therefore inherited from the generic Rectangular\+Quad\+Mesh }{\pageref{classShellMesh}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{classShellProblem}{Shell\+Problem$<$ ELEMENT $>$}} }{\pageref{classShellProblem}}{}
