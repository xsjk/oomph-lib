# DESCRIPTION:
# ------------
# Generalise the creation of an oomph-lib library for the cases the process is
# easy to automate. This typically occurs when we have a set of headers and
# (possibly) a set of sources, and all we want to do is create a library from
# these headers/sources then install them in the standard location (i.e.
# build/include). A combined header will be created in build/include/ with the
# name ${LIBNAME}.h which includes the relevant headers/sources that will be
# installed to build/include/${LIBNAME}/.
#
# If no sources are provided then we assume that the library should be
# header-only and it will thus be created as an INTERFACE library.
#
# IMPORTANT:
# ----------
# This function must be called from the directory containing the files we need
# to build the library as the ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR} variable will hold the
# path to the calling directory, so we won't need to ask the user to provide it.
# For more details, see pg. 59 of:
#
#           "Scott Craig (2021), Professional CMake: A Practical Guide"
#
# USAGE:
# ------
#     include(OomphLibraryConfig)
#     oomph_library_config(LIBNAME             <library-name>
#                          [HEADERS            <headers-of-the-library>]
#                          [SOURCES            <sources-of-the-library>]
#                          [SOURCES_NO_BUILD   <sources-to-install-only>]
#                          [HEADERS_NO_COMBINE <headers-to-install-only>]
#                          [HEADERS_NO_INSTALL <headers-to-not-install>])
#
# The keyword HEADERS_NO_COMBINE is used to define extra headers that need to be
# installed in build/include but should not be placed in the combined header.
# These are typically headers that the system defines and not those associated
# with the library itself. The keyword SOURCES_NO_BUILD is used to refer to
# sources that are part of the library but should not be built such as template
# implementation headers (for pure template headers, e.g. meshes). These files
# will be installed to the include directory and also added in the combined
# header. The keyword HEADERS_NO_INSTALL is used to refer to headers that the
# library depends on but should not be part of the combined header or be placed
# in build/include/. This is helpful, for example, for fortran headers, like in
# src/generic.
#
# The above is summarised in the table below:
#
#   +--------------------+--------------+--------------------+-------------+
#   |           ARGUMENT | LIBRARY DEP. | IN COMBINED HEADER |  INSTALLED  |

#   |            SOURCES |      x       |                    |      x      |
#   |   SOURCES_NO_BUILD |      x       |         x          |      x      |
#   | HEADERS_NO_COMBINE |      x       |                    |      x      |

  # 1. Install ${LIBNAME} in <INSTALL-DIR>/lib,
  # 2. Install ${LIBNAME}.h in <INSTALL-DIR>/include, and
  # 3. Install ${HEADERS} in <INSTALL-DIR>/include/${LIBNAME}
  #
  # The header ${LIBNAME}.h in <INSTALL-DIR>/include will include the relevant
  # headers from <INSTALL-DIR>/include/${LIBNAME}/. This allows us to group
  # associated headers together.

  # TODO: Add a note somewhere that the library directory should either match

  # source directory...
  #
  # When headers get installed to "<INSTALL-PATH>/oomphlib/include/<SUBDIR>/",
  # we provide a combined header in the ".../include/" directory that can be
  # included by the user to include all files shipped with a library. The
  # include paths in the combined header have the form

  # The "<SUBDIR>" is simply the folder that encloses it.
  # Therefore we need to the correct "<SUBDIR>" value. In most cases, this is
